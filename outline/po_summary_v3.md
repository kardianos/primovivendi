## Key Points

**Epistemology:** Reality is real, reality is knowable, truth is what corresponds to reality, reality is consequential. Truth matters independent of perceived consequences.

**Individual:** Be humble, know you are limited and selfish and not naturally good, seek excellence.

**Society:** Tiered self-anchored responsibility, procedural symmetry, generational obligation.

**Judgment:** Judgment separates what is good and what is not good, judgment is necessary.

**Goodness:** Goodness is rooted in the foundational axiom that human life should continue and continue well, both generationally and individually. Survival, Truth, and Procedural Symmetry are necessary for life to continue well. Judgment is necessary to separate what serves this goodness and what oppose it. Beauty arises from goodness.

**Love:** Love is expressed as either costly, prioritized action or as general goodwill. Enemies are a reality, but forgiveness can be offered as a "golden bridge" to those who demonstrably reform their actions.



## For:

* Consequential knowable reality
* Humans are limited and selfish
* Procedural symmetry
* Tiered self-anchored responsibility
* Goodness: human life should continue and continue well.


## Against:

* Constructivism: reality is real not just in the mind of God or society.
* Value symmetry: don't engage in society based on equal value exchange both good and bad.
* Outcome symmetry: don't engage in society believing every person should have the same things or the same outcome.
* Altruism: actions should be self anchored.
* Egoism: actions should not be self absorbed.
* Pure reason: thinking, including reasoning, detached from reality is little more then hallucinating.
