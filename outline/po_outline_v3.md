## Part A: The Foundation, What Is

1. [axiom] Reality is Real. Reality is what exists, what is.

	* If I drop a ball, it falls to the ground due to gravity. This happens regardless of my thoughts or desires, demonstrating that reality operates independently of subjective influence.

2. [A.1] Truth is what corresponds to reality.

	* Since reality is what exists, truth is the accurate representation or description of that reality. For example, if a tree stands in a field, the statement "There is a tree in the field" is true because it matches what exists. This implies that truth can be verified by observing reality, allowing us to distinguish fact from fiction.

3. [A.1][A.2] Truth is consequential, knowable, and worth knowing.

	* If a person jumps off a high cliff without special equipment, they will die. We can reliably state "if this happens, then this will happen".
We cannot change the consequences reality imposes by thinking up some idea and believing life would be better if reality conformed to that idea.
Instead we must carefully look to cause and effect within reality. When we physically survive or when our idea works and produces the expected results, our idea or way of living can be said to align with reality.
	* The human mind is capable of understanding a consistently presented reality.
So long as my proxies to reality, in this case my senses, are self-consistent my
mind can make sense of it. As a demonstration of this, multi-modal LLMs have completely different
proxies to reality (senses); they have pixels and digital values, yet when presented with the same
picture that a human sees, an LLM can extract the same information from it that a human extracts.
Thus the argument that someone might see purple differently or that our sensory organs might be different, while true, is irrelevant. The only thing that is needed to know reality is self-consistent proxies to reality; the proxies themselves can be different.
	* Another example of this is demonstrated in clinical attachment theory.
Specifically, disorganized attachment is when the child
experiences contradictory behavior from their caregiver, and their caregiver can be seen as a proxy to reality.
Sometimes the child will get comfort from their caregiver and other times they will be frightened or hurt from their caregiver and when which is which is unpredictable.
As such the child fails to form a strategy to handle distress.
The fact that we can reason about the world and that we can form methods to handle reality
indicate that the world itself is normally predictable.
	* Reality is knowable even without drastic contrasts. Light can be measured without reference to darkness.

4. [axiom] Humans are limited, selfish, and not naturally good.

	* Humans are inherently limited; humans are limited in their time and their ability to understand.
	* Humans are fundamentally selfish, they are driven to their own survival and well-being.

5. [axiom] The foundation of goodness is that human life should continue and continue well.

	* Reality is knowable but morality needs a foundational value to serve as a standard for judgment.
This is a chosen foundational value is that human life should continue and continue well.
	* Even though this is a chosen value, it is grounded: any human who has survived to this point in history has ancestors who ultimately chose survival and today's society has many good standards and comforts because in the past people chose to live well. This value is not an arbitrary choice from many options, it is the recognition of a prerequisite. All other philosophical debates are luxuries afforded to those who have life and survive.
	* From this starting point we can judge actions, systems, and ideas. Do they add to or subtract from humans living and living well? Do they support and encourage people to bear the next generation or do they work against having the next generation?
	* Living well is not a destination. Living well is not a utopia. Living well is recognition that life takes work, and to constantly engage in that, such as sweep the floor or spending time with your kids.
	* You can measure living well by measuring two points in time, the first point the floor was dirty and got your feet dirty as you walked over it which got your sheets dirty when you got into bed. The second point you kept your floor clean which helped keep your feet clean which helped keep your sheets clean. The slope between these two points is positive so we are engaging in living well. Living well is not a destination but a vector. It is measured by the positive slope between two points in time.
	* Living well is applicable at any level of wealth or position. If we are free and wealthy, seek to live well. If we are in prison, seek to live well. In what is in your control, live well.

## Part B: The Bridge to Ethics, from What Is to What Should Be

1. [A.1] Survival is the basic alignment to reality.

	* When an animal species survives in a specific environment, we can say it survives reality.
If an animal species dies in a specific environment, it does not survive reality; it is not aligned
to reality in that environment.
	* Similarly, a mathematician may come up with a new theorem. Another person publishes a single equation
that demonstrates that the new theorem is not accurate with the stated boundary conditions. The new theorem does not survive and is not aligned to reality.

2. [A.3] There are better and worse ways of living.

	* Choosing each day to cause yourself pain and injury is worse than living in good health at peace with yourself.
Living each day half starved is worse than living with sufficient food to survive and work.
It is better to have someone help me when I am down than to have someone kick me when I am down.

3. [A.3][A.5][B.2] Objective goodness exists.

	* Objective goodness exists and is knowable because reality is consequential and we have a criterion to judge. The criterion for judgment is humans living and living well.
	* It is nonsensical and even harmful to say "I am Good." Goodness is ultimately human living and living well.
	* Goodness is humans living, for instance I could say "All other things equal, it is better to not jump off a cliff than to jump off a cliff."
	* Goodness is humans living well, for instance I could say "All other things equal, it is better to rest my hand on a soft pillow then a hot flame."
	* Human understanding of what will ultimately produce goodness is limited, because humans are limited. Despite human limitations, humans can know what is good.
	* To know what is good requires each person to align with truth; that is, we must seek out reality and be able to speak it back to others and act on it. By observing and measuring outcomes in reality, we can establish standards of goodness that are not merely subjective but grounded in the consequences that reality imposes.

4. [A.3][A.4] Procedural Symmetry is the basis for society. Each person lives under the same procedures as others in the same society.

	* Procedural Symmetry works for groups of people who share the same fundamental value of wanting humans to live and to live well.
	* Given that reality is consequential and humans are selfish a stable society can be built on the principles of procedural symmetry. To secure my own interests I need to advocate for a system that gives the same procedures to others.
	* Mechanically, procedural symmetry works through mutual self-interest.
	* If you show up and do good work, you get compensated for that work. If you break the law, you are judged by the same procedure as everyone else, in the court of law. Justice and rewards are imperfectly applied, but each person, as much as is possible, are given the same imperfect justice and rewards that the society affords. Following the method of "procedural symmetry", judge others (the procedure) how you would like to be judged (symmetry). But do judge or goodness will wither.
	* Procedural symmetry does not mean "love everyone", nor does it mean everyone has the same things. Procedural symmetry means you should love your spouse as you want your spouse to love you. We cannot love everyone because humans are limited. It means a rich person is judged by the same procedures as a poor person.
	* By recognizing others are human just like we are human, we can realize that if we want to be treated in a certain way, we must convince others to treat others in that way. To convince others to treat us well, we come up with a rule: "I will treat you how I want you to treat me and you do likewise." This is the basis for procedural symmetry.
	* Another use of procedural symmetry is to determine more accurate models. If we apply the same procedure to different proposals to the same question then we can determine which model answers the question better.
	* Procedural symmetry can be applied over generations (have kids and raise them well just as you were born and desired to be raised), to the procedural application of law, to the application of logic, and to the application of criteria to decide.

## Part C: Principles of a Good Society

1. [B.3][B.4] Judgment is what separates what is good and what is not good.

	* Judgment is necessary to distinguish what is good and what is not. Judgment is not bad; judgment is necessary for goodness to thrive.
	* For example, in a society, judgment is exercised through laws and social norms that distinguish acceptable behavior from unacceptable, thereby promoting goodness. This implies that without active judgment, societies could not maintain order or foster conditions where goodness prevails.

2. [A.5][B.4] Our generational obligation is to reproduce the life and goodness we ourselves have.

	* It is good to survive and live.
It is then imperative that I do not allow the goodness that I enjoy to wither away or be overtaken by what is evil or even what is significantly less good.
If I allow this, I will be violating the procedural symmetry principle.
If I truly see value in others and believe what I have is good, then I have a generational obligation to teach others my skills and teachings so that they can also thrive. I also have a generational obligation to have children, just as I was given life by my parents.
	* By having children and educating the next generation and ensuring they have the tools to succeed, such as teaching them practical skills or ethical values, we fulfill our obligation to perpetuate goodness.
	* Generational obligation is the time variant of procedural symmetry.

3. [A.4] Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility means relationships closer to yourself should be prioritized.

	* Tiered self-anchored responsibility is the cornerstone of social perspective. 
Do not give your food to strangers and neglect your family; meeting your own needs and your family's needs comes first.
Our priority should start with ourselves, then our family, then our neighbors, then our community, then our state, then our nation. Everyone else comes last.
Enemies, people who actively seek to do you harm, have negative value.
	* We can still sacrifice. At times we may choose to care for our enemies.
But sacrifice or caring for strangers should not come at the expense of family.
	* Being self-anchored does not imply being selfish (egoism). Just the opposite, after you see to yourself, you must then see to your spouse, your children, your neighbors, and your nation. But it must be in that order, with your resources, both time and money, allocated in that priority.
	* Procedural symmetry and tiered self-anchored responsibility work together to lift people up, first from within the family, then within the community.

4. Love can be dispositional or action based.

	* All love must align with our self-anchored responsibility.
	* Dispositional love is the general goodwill and non-malice towards all, even those outside of your inner tiers of responsibility. Offering others a general dispositional love makes procedural symmetry possible. It can be expressed by not wishing others in your society harm and respecting the rule of law.
	* Action based love especially must be self-anchored, where you love those around you first and forward with your actions, and never offer love to a friend or stranger greater than what you would love your spouse or family.
	* Action based love has an opportunity cost; when you love your family there is limited time to offer action based love to a stranger. All human time and resources are limited, we must prioritize what we spend our time and resources on. This is the bedrock of a strong family and community.

5. Enemies, Accountability, and the Choice of Forgiveness

	* Enemies are real. There are people who glorify death, who seek to subvert foundational societal principles like procedural symmetry, or who invert self-anchored responsibility to the detriment of your family and community. There are complete egoists and narcissists who fail to ever take responsibility. Recognizing an enemy is a necessary act of judgment aligned with reality.
	* Enemies are not defined by disagreements over policies, but by either directly opposing your or your family's survival or by their rejection of the core principles necessary for life.
	* A victim or others in society must not withhold negative consequences from an enemy. The enemy must bear the consequences, not the victim.
	* Only after accountability is established can the wronged party consider the tool of forgiveness. Forgiveness is not a moral obligation placed upon the victim; it is a strategic choice they can make for their own benefit or the benefit of their society. It is the "Golden Bridge" that offers a reformed enemy a path back to cooperation, but it is a bridge the wronged party chooses if, when, and how to build.
	* This choice is highly conditional and pragmatic. You might offer this path if an enemy demonstrates, through sustained action, a genuine change and aligned values. Even then, you must be realistic. Offering clemency to an enemy who holds to an aligned virtue (like a Roman rival) may be effective. Attempting it with an enemy who values your destruction (like the Huns, Assyrians, or the Kanem-Bornu Empire) is not noble sacrifice; it is foolish and wasted. The well-being of yourself, your family, and your community must be the standard by which this choice is measured.


## Part D: Principles of the Individual

1. [B.3] Take responsibility.

	* Goodness does not happen with nothing else attached. Someone has to choose to look at a situation and decide "this mess is not how I would like to live, I need to clean up this mess so I don't live in filth." This requires owning a situation, or owning how you live, or owning your tools or living space. Once you take ownership, you can seek goodness. This is responsibility. Taking responsibility isn't some trite set of words spoken. Taking responsibility is action after ownership.
	* Taking responsibility is not just admitting that your action caused something bad or good to happen; taking responsibility is owning the situation and caring for the outcome.
For example, if I hit a ball through a window, I might align with truth and admit that I hit the ball that broke the window. But responsibility is to take ownership of the situation and act 
as if that window were my own, fixing it with my own resources.
Another example would be if a man gets a woman pregnant. Taking responsibility isn't to just admit that the child is yours, but to care for the child and mother as you would care for yourself.

2. [A.3][A.4] Align with truth and be humble.

	* Knowing truth and aligning with it is necessary to live in goodness.
Seek to know and align ourselves with truth as best as we are able to.
Because of our own limitations, we should know that we might be wrong. In a word, we should be humble.
	* For instance, a scientist who admits a hypothesis might be incorrect and revises it based on new evidence exemplifies this principle. This approach ensures that our pursuit of goodness remains adaptable and grounded in reality.

3. [D.2] Seek excellence.

	* Once you know what is good to do, you have to do it, and do it well. Aligning with truth requires you seek it out, then seek excellence as you strive to do what is good.
	* For instance, in professional work, seeking excellence means not just completing tasks but doing so with high quality and integrity. This pursuit elevates both personal and communal standards of goodness.

4. [D.1] Admire Beauty as a Result of Responsibility.

	* The beauty that is good is the polished form after someone bears ownership and responsibility.
	* For an individual, beauty could be a washed face and patched, not holed, clothes.
	* For a house, beauty is dusted, clean floors and tables, ready for human use.
	* For a neighborhood, beauty is free of graffiti and trash.


## Key Decisions

It is important to provide contrast with different beliefs to set explicit limits on what is intended.

### Symmetry

Even once you establish the need to see yourself in others, societies could value different forms of symmetry:

 * A society could value "value symmetry", where justice is "an eye for an eye".
 * A society could value "outcome symmetry", where justice is when money, resources, even abilities are adjusted until everyone has the same outcome.
 * I value "procedural symmetry" where each person is allowed the same procedures in life. If you show up and do good work, you get compensated for that work. If you break the law, you are judged by the same procedure as everyone else, in the court of law. Justice and rewards are imperfectly applied, but each person, as much as is possible, are given the same imperfect justice and rewards that the society affords.

Mercy in each of these forms of symmetry is also important to note:

 * Mercy in "value symmetry" is to charge the perpetrator less than what their actions cost.
 * Mercy in "outcome symmetry" cannot exist, because anything less than equal outcomes is an ongoing injustice.
 * Mercy in "procedural symmetry" is discretionary clemency enacted for what is ethically good, even if it goes against the law.

### Human Limits

Humans are limited and selfish. I advocate for systems that understand this and take it into account when making decisions and designing social structures. For example because people are limited, we must advance our own needs first, then our family's needs, and so on outward based on our proximity. We make better decisions when we are first stakeholders of them and when we know the details of the situation. Secondly, we are selfish, so we must always create controls or checks and balances, assuming that people if left unconstrained will act selfishly and in their own interest.

Others believe in an unconstrained vision of humanity. Where with enough effort and knowledge, people can design an entire society and govern it. This sometimes results in communistic or fascistic or other totalitarian outcomes. An unconstrained vision of humanity also believes that human selfishness and evil is a product of an imperfect society, that when humans create the correct society, humans will become correct. In effect, any person who then resists this new society that will bring about a new society and thus a new humanity, must be sidelined or removed.

Unconstrained vision of humanity does not reflect reality and produces evil results.

### Reality

Reality is independently knowable. Others believe that truth is constructed (from the structure of society or from our ideals), this viewpoint is called constructivism. Constructivism is prevalent today and produces evil. Constructivism believes that all knowledge is socially constructed and that reality cannot be truly known. There are two primary variants of constructivism:

 1. Social Constructivism: Man constructs truth and knowledge. Reality cannot be known, so we use various ways of knowing to construct meaning. What is truth is mediated through man.
 2. Divine Constructivism: God constructs truth and knowledge. Reality cannot be known, except as revealed by God. What is true is mediated through God.

In a reality that is knowable. You can phrase the idea that reality is knowable in two different ways:

 1. What is, is material. We can know reality through our (mostly) self-consistent senses, such as our eyes and ears. Our minds are material and when we die, we cease.
 2. We live in a material world. God created all that is, but God himself, is. God may live outside the material world we can immediately sense, but the material world is ordered and knowable. God chooses to reveal himself to humans in part through His creation (Christians may reference Romans 1:20).

Theist or atheist, reality is independently knowable.

Pure reason, detached from reality, is little more than hallucinating.

#### Answering Constructivism

Some believe in a form of social constructivism where they argue while physical reality, such as gravity or the sky, exist, all meaning is socially constructed. They may argue that the value of money, the authority of law, and the concept of a nation are not found in nature but in collective fictions. They may continue the argument that if society (our collective fiction) shapes man, then it is our social obligation to deconstruct these collective fictions to create a more just society.

The fundamental error with social constructivism, even when it appears to have realist roots, is they mistake something "found in society" for something "constructed by society". Money is not a construct of society, it is a consequence of society. If you are alone in the world you have no need of money. But if you are in society and you specialize in X but want B, C, and D, then money is just a representation of abstract value that allows you to trade your X to people who want it and still get B, C, and D, even though they don't directly want your X. Money is a consequence of that fundamental aspect of society. Similarly nations exist at the boundary of where rule of law ends. A nation is the consequence of different groups of people wanting incompatible things. This doesn't imply that how money is regulated or how a nation behaves cannot be criticized or improved, just the opposite of that. We must be responsible and held to account for how we handle the consequences of reality: how we manage money, how we enact and setup laws. But note the framing is much different then the social constructivism. We no longer see to deconstruct, but we ask how we can best own our responsibility for the natural consequences of working together in society.


### Responsibility

Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility is the cornerstone of responsibility. After aligning with truth, each must seek their own goodness, then the goodness of their spouse, then their family, then their community, then state, then nation, then others after that.
A person may choose to help others. They may choose to sacrifice.
But so long as each person seeks goodness, after aligning to truth, in tiers starting with myself and family and going outward, goodness will flourish. So long as each seeks their own goodness and of those around them, so long as they stay within the rule of law which governs conflicts of interest, goodness will increase for all.
People who wish to actively do you harm have negative value.

All Viewpoints in relational responsibility include:

 1. Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility: My first responsibility is to myself and my family, then my neighbors, then my state and nation. Enemies, people who actively wish to do you or your family harm, have negative value.
 2. Universalism: Every person regardless of relationship to you deserves the same ethical consideration. Even the people who actively wish to do you harm.
 3. Radical Altruism: Ethical and moral obligations prioritizes the most distant and least connected entities (such as the earth and the environment), then animals, then strangers, then finally your family and self.
 4. Egoism: You act only in ways that benefit yourself directly.

Universalism works in extremely cohesive societies without immediate enemies, but breaks down when people groups don't share the same universalism ethics. In practice, radical altruism is societal suicide. Unconstrained egoism will lead to unbound corruption and significantly degrade society.

Responsibility should be tiered and self-anchored.


### Rule

The Rule of Law is how a society can choose to judge its citizens. Ideally each citizen is provided the same procedure and is judged against the same laws as any other citizen.
The Rule by Man is an alternative, where judgments are made by decisions of individuals. Man is fickle; I do not support the Rule by Man.
Even when the Rule of Law is implemented and practiced by those who are flawed and limited, because it follows recorded procedure, we can appeal when procedures are not followed.
Justice by Rule of Law will always have some flaws, because it is carried out by those who are flawed. But that doesn't mean we should throw the whole thing out. On the contrary, we should appreciate what the Rule of Law brings individuals and society.

But the rule of law is good in so much as it rules with procedural symmetry. If someone is silent and takes no action while the rule of law is blatantly and systematically violated for months or years, but then yells to the rooftops when another tries to correct the problem previously introduced, bending a law slightly to do so, that person does not respect procedural symmetry or the rule of law; they just want to turn the social ratchet to their direction and only in their direction.

The critical aspect of the rule of law is not the law, for it is a dumb piece of paper, nor the whims of man, for man is fickle. The critical aspect of the rule of law is that it reflects procedural symmetry. If the law becomes something which is not that, it is not a rule of law I can respect.
This does not endorse anyone violating the constitution or laws. But these ethics (how each should live) and epistemology (how each believes) are not rooted in either.

### Scale

All of these principle will have efficacy at any scale they are practiced. Even if just one person, one family, or one community these principles can bring benefit and cohesion.

However, the core principles of valuing life, procedural symmetry, tiered self-anchored responsibility, and generational obligation must all be present and work together.

Emotion and empathy can be good within close relationships and family. At the scale of communities and the wider society empathy and emotion are actively harmful. In a wider society empathy fails to recognize those who consistently fail at personal responsibility and those who actively work against your own interest. Empathy and emotion are for close relationships only.
