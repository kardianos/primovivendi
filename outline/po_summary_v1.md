# Procedural Objectivism

Epistemology: Reality is real, reality is knowable, truth is what corresponds to reality, reality is consequential. Truth matters independent of perceived consequences.

Individual: Be humble, know you are limited and selfish and not naturally good, seek excellence.

Society: Tiered self-anchored responsibility, procedural symmetry, generational obligation.

Judgment: Judgment separates what is good and what is not good, judgment is necessary.

Goodness is rooted in valuing that human life should continue, both generationally and individually, and continue well. Derived from this is that goodness is knowable, objective, that beauty is good, survival is good, procedural symmetry is good, tiered self-anchored responsibility is good, and that aligning with truth is good.

Love: Two types acting love and dispositional love, acting love has an opportunity cost, dispositional love is not specific.



## For:

Consequential knowable reality
Humans are limited and selfish
Procedural symmetry
Tiered self-anchored responsibility
Goodness: human life should continue and continue well.


## Against:

Constructivism: reality is real not just in the mind of God or society.
Value symmetry: don't engage in society based on equal value exchange both good and bad.
Outcome symmetry: don't engage in society believing every person should have the same things or the same outcome.
Altruism: actions should be self anchored.
Egoism: actions should not be self absorbed.
Pure reason: thinking, including reasoning, detached from reality is little more then hallucinating.
