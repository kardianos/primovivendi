## Chapter 4: Tiered, Self-Anchored Responsibility

Humans are born into this word in utter poverty, naked and helpless, extremely limited in ability. In short, we are born into this world in complete poverty where the cold and heat will kill us without remorse, and hunger will overcome us without our mother's milk. Everything beyond this complete poverty requires harnessing the world around us. We must find food, find material suitable for building a shelter, build a shelter, maintain a shelter, keep the heat fired up during cold nights so as not to freeze to death.

Responsibility is behavior capable of creating and maintaining. Responsibility is taking time to find food. Responsibility is taking time to build a shelter and keep it safe and warm. In society with many more people then just ourselves, we specialize so this can be harder to see. Rather than building everything ourselves, we may go to an office and work as an accountant tracking a company's value ledger. For this service we are given money, which represents some value. We then give that money to others for shelter, heat, and food. In a specialized society, we trade our ability to create and maintain for the abilities of others.

Each person’s responsibility starts with themselves: creating our own lives and shaping our future for the better, for our own continuance. This could be as simple as sweeping your floor, or as complex as working to secure food. Our responsibility does not end with ourselves, but it begins there. Our responsibility for ourselves is the greatest.

Responsibility is the general concept needed to create and maintain life:

* Building a house requires careful consideration, planning, and exact measurements. It also means not destroying the foundation or weakening load bearing walls. Maintaining a house also means not destroying the foundation or weakening load bearing walls. Maintaining also means to not randomly knock holes in walls or letting water sit and rot the floor.
* Growing food requires cultivating the soil; you would not salt the earth and expect food to grow from it. Even if you don't grow food yourself, to maintain the food we separate poison, such as bleach, and good food.
* Raising children takes time, energy, and will to care for the children.
* Managing a team requires a mindset of owning what the team produces and wanting the team to fulfill its goals.

**Responsibility is the mindset of creating and maintaining.**

**Responsibility begins with ourselves.** A man who fails to take care of himself, cannot create or maintain anything. This doesn't imply we should never sacrifice ourselves for our children or country, but rather, our responsibility is what makes the sacrifice what it is: laying down ourselves for others who we are responsible for. But sacrifice cannot be the normalized or by itself healthy; even though sacrifice is sometimes necessary.

**From the self, responsibility radiates outward in concentric circles of decreasing intensity**: spouse and children → extended family → neighbors and local community → fellow countrymen → the rest of humanity. The gradient is not arbitrary; it reflects the hard limits of time, knowledge, and loyalty, and symmetric obligation for each circle. We can dispositionally love humanity in the abstract, but we can only be responsible for the concrete few whom we actually know and who know us.

**Responsibility must also recognize enemies.** Termites who are entering the house we carefully built are enemies (though they are not enemies if they are in the forest). If a country or group states they want to abolish or kill your nation, they are your enemy. Failing to recognize this is dangerous and suicidal.

The fate of the Moriori of the Chatham Islands starkly illustrates the peril of failing to recognize and resist an existential enemy. In 1835, Māori tribes armed with muskets and shaped by a warrior culture of conquest invaded the islands, openly declaring their intent to seize the land and either exterminate or enslave the inhabitants. The Moriori, long bound by their ancestor Nunuku’s covenant of absolute non-violence, welcomed the invaders with traditional hospitality, offering food, shelter, and resources. The Māori accepted this generosity until they had fully recovered their strength, then began the systematic slaughter and enslavement that within years reduced a population of over two thousand to barely a hundred survivors. To a conquering people, the Moriori’s principled kindness was merely a weakness to exploit; to the Moriori themselves, clinging to pacifism in the face of announced genocide proved collective suicide. If you wish your peaceful way of life to survive against those who openly seek your destruction, you must be willing to identify the enemy and destroy him before he destroys you. Responsibility demands nothing less.

Humans are limited. Each person has finite hours in a day. We cannot know what each person needs or what is good for them. Thinking everyone has the same outlook or needs, or that you can know everyone, is not humble.

It is prideful to try to give each person the same consideration. This is sometimes called Universalism, it should be rejected.

It is not good to care for "everyone on earth" or "all the strangers on a different continent". This can be called radical altruism, it should be rejected.

Humans are limited and are responsibility must be tiered. But we must strive to what is good.
