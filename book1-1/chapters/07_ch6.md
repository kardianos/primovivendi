## Chapter 6: The Unifying Principle of Procedural Symmetry

Procedural Symmetry is the principle of applying the same rules and methods of evaluation consistently to all subjects within a given domain. It requires that the process for judging an idea, action, or person remains the same whether it applies to you or to others. The defining feature is unwavering consistency in the procedure itself, distinct from any focus on achieving a particular or equal outcome.

This principle manifests in five distinct areas:

1.  **In the Social Domain:** Procedural Symmetry requires that the processes governing social interaction are applied uniformly to all members.
    *   **Rule of Law:** The legal process, from investigation to trial, must be identical for all individuals, irrespective of identity or status. The procedure for adjudicating a theft claim remains constant for the accused and the accuser.
    *   **Freedom of Speech:** The procedure of public discourse must remain available to all. Direct incitement to violence breaks this symmetry because it uses speech to deny another person the ability to use that same procedure, creating an inconsistent application of the rules.

2.  **In Truth-Seeking:** The same methods of critical evaluation must be applied to all claims, regardless of origin or our biases. The procedure for scrutinizing a new, favored theory must be identical to that used for an old, established one. Consistency ensures the focus remains on the validity of the idea itself.

3.  **In Logic:** The principle is expressed as formal validity, where the reliability of a deductive argument’s structure is independent of its content. A logical form like *modus ponens* (If P then Q; P; therefore Q) is a consistent procedure that yields a valid conclusion regardless of the specific propositions. The procedure’s integrity guarantees its function.

4.  **In Behavior:** This operates as a method for evaluating a rule of conduct by applying it universally and reciprocally. To test a behavioral procedure (e.g., “It is acceptable to break a promise for personal gain”), one must assess the systemic outcome if everyone, including oneself, followed that same rule. The procedure’s viability is determined by its functional consequences when applied symmetrically.

5.  **Generationally:** Applied across time, this principle manifests in child-rearing. Every living person is the result of a predecessor generation undertaking the procedure of raising them from dependency to independence. Procedural Symmetry requires that the current generation, having received this process, applies the same procedure in turn by raising children. This establishes a consistent, reciprocal link between generations, ensuring humanity’s continuation by repeating the fundamental process that enabled one’s own existence.

6.  **In Conflict:** Applied in conflict, the goal is the future survival and future peace of our society. Defending our home does not come only after an intruder has murdered someone, but the act of intrusion is enough to warrant the use of deadly force. For nations: in peace we strive for diplomacy and trade, but if another nation injures our nation, then the goal is our society's survival and future peace. So we follow our procedure to achieve that. Perhaps the response is overwhelming economic or military force. Perhaps the policy is 1000 heads for a citizen's head. This is not retributive, but a pre-published policy aiming for peace.

When Procedural Symmetry is not embraced, people often default to two inferior alternatives: Value Symmetry or Outcome Symmetry.

### Value Symmetry (“An eye for an eye”)
Value Symmetry creates a direct, equivalent correspondence between an action and its consequence. It serves as both a justification for retribution and a *limit* upon it. By demanding that the scales of justice be balanced, it prevents excessive vengeance but frames justice as a backward-looking transaction. When elevated to a supreme law, it breeds rigid, dogmatic systems.
*   **Socially:** Justice becomes a primitive calculus for retribution (e.g., the Code of Hammurabi), focused on settling past scores.
*   **In Truth-Seeking:** Inquiry corrupts into debate where the goal is to balance the rhetorical score. Challenging dogma is seen as a “harm” that must be balanced by punishing the questioner.
*   **In Logic:** Logic is misapplied. Pointing out a contradiction in a sacred text is seen as an attack, “balanced” by declaring the text exempt from secular logic.
*   **In Behavior:** The ethic is *Lex Talionis*: “Do unto others *what they have done unto you*.” As a highest law, it justifies endless cycles of vengeance.
*   **Generationally:** Tradition is sanctified. Replicating the past becomes a moral duty to “repay” ancestors. Change is seen as disrespect.
*   **In Conflict:** If an enemy kills or dishonors one of our own, then we must kill or dishonor the enemy to repay them. Peace is not their goal, but to balance a perceived ledger.

### Outcome Symmetry (“Equal Outcomes”)
Outcome Symmetry is fixated on achieving a predetermined future where all individuals and groups have identical results. It requires the unequal application of rules to redistribute resources and status. As a totalizing worldview, it functions as a secular religion.
*   **Socially:** The Rule of Law is subordinated to “equity,” leading to unequal processes based on group identity. Speech is managed to ensure equal impact, requiring censorship.
*   **In Truth-Seeking:** Objective standards are rejected for intellectual relativism. The scientific method may be dismissed as a “colonial” power structure. “Lived experience” becomes unimpeachable revelation.
*   **In Logic:** Formal logic is attacked as a tool of the “oppressor” because it creates inequality between valid and invalid arguments.
*   **In Behavior:** Individual merit is suspect. The highest virtue is collective action to dismantle hierarchies. Morality is defined by allegiance to the oppressed.
*   **Generationally:** History is a linear narrative from a sinful past of inequality toward a redemptive future of equity. The current generation has a messianic duty to purge the past.
*   **In Conflict:** We want all people to live. There are no true enemies, only people who have misunderstandings. The only enemies are moral enemies who do not want justice or equal outcomes to prevail.

### Our Action
Recognize when justifications stem from Outcome Symmetry or Value Symmetry. Choose to embrace Procedural Symmetry and avoid the others.
