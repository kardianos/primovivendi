## Chapter 6: The Necessity of Judgment

The principle of Procedural Symmetry is not a call to be “non-judgmental” or morally passive. On the contrary, it is the very thing that *enables* and *demands* fair judgment. It provides the standard for *how* we must judge, but it equally insists that we *must* judge. A rule that is never enforced is not a rule; it is a hollow suggestion. The laws and norms that protect us become meaningless without the active and courageous willingness to identify when they have been violated. Goodness and justice cannot flourish if they are not vigilantly protected by the sharp, clear lines of fair judgment.

Procedural Symmetry requires judgment to operate. In logic, if someone applies one critical method to their favored idea but a more lenient method to what they wish to disprove, it requires separating this inconsistent action as "not good," and this separation is an act of judgment. In a family, if there is a rule to not talk with your mouth full, and someone violates it, we must separate that action and judge it as incorrect. So too for the laws in our society. Procedural Symmetry is the skeleton of a just order; judgment is the muscle that allows it to stand and act.

In this context, judgment is not an emotional outburst of condemnation. It is the vital act of discernment: the intellectual process of separating what is good from what is not, what is helpful from what is harmful. A society that refuses to judge has lost its will to live. It is like an immune system that no longer distinguishes between a healthy cell and a cancer. It will be consumed by the social pathogens of crime, corruption, and decay. The alternative to a world of careful judgment is not a kinder world, but a world where standards inevitably decline to the lowest common denominator.

It is human to resist negative judgment. No one enjoys being told they are wrong, and pride makes any critique feel like a personal attack. But this pain, like touching a hot stove, is productive feedback. It is a signal from reality, telling us that our actions are not aligned with the good, and it is a vital opportunity to correct our course. A society that tries to shield its members from this pain robs them of the essential feedback they need to learn and grow.

Understanding this allows us to distinguish between true mercy and its destructive counterfeit, permissiveness. Mercy can only exist *after* a negative judgment has been made. To be merciful is to see an act, judge it as wrong, and then consciously choose not to apply the full, just consequences that the action deserves. Mercy requires the clarity to judge and the strength to forbear. Permissiveness, in contrast, is the failure to judge in the first place. It is not kindness; it is neglect. The permissive parent who never judges their child’s harmful behavior is not being merciful; they are abandoning their duty to teach right from wrong. Mercy is a form of strength that acknowledges a wrong within a well-defended moral order. Permissiveness is weakness that allows that order to decay.

Judgment, then, is the engine that gives Procedural Symmetry its power. Procedural Symmetry provides the standard, but judgment is the active, courageous application of that standard. It is the tool we use to police the crucial boundaries of our world, to distinguish the citizen from the enemy, the honest error from the deliberate fraud, the constructive act from the destructive one. Without the will to judge, the Rule of Law dissolves into the rule of the strongest, and the social contract is rendered void.

This vital engine of judgment, however, operates within a finite vessel. Humans are limited and have limited time. Our energy, attention, and knowledge are all strictly bounded. We cannot apply the same level of rigorous judgment and active care to every person and every problem on the planet. To attempt to do so is to guarantee failure, spreading our finite resources so thinly that they become ineffective everywhere. An obligation to everyone quickly becomes an obligation to no one. This reality forces a critical question upon us: If judgment is necessary and our capacity for it is finite, where must we apply it most diligently? To whom do we owe our primary care?
