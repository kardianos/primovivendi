## Chapter 16: Tiered vs. Universalism, Altruism, or Egoism

The destructive public policies we have just examined, those that prioritize the criminal over the community, the addict over the citizen, and the abstract global good over the nation’s security, are not isolated mistakes. They are the predictable result of a flawed answer to the most crucial question of relational ethics: To whom do I owe my loyalty and my limited resources? Having firmly planted our feet on the ground of a knowable reality, we must now dissect the philosophies that lead to such disastrous consequences. Procedural Objectivism’s answer, Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility, stands in stark, realistic contrast to its main competitors, which can be placed on a spectrum from the selfless to the selfish.

At one extreme lies Radical Altruism, the ethical belief that one's moral duty is to prioritize the most distant and least connected entities. At the other lies pure Egoism, the belief that one should act only in ways that directly benefit oneself. Both are philosophies at war with reality. A society of altruists would see its families dissolve; a society of egoists would be a swamp of treachery.

Between these poles lies Universalism, the noble-sounding ideal that every person on earth deserves our equal ethical consideration. It argues that we should be completely impartial, that the life of a stranger is worth just as much as the life of our own child. While its allure is powerful, this philosophy fails the test of reality. It is impossible for limited humans to care for everyone equally. More dangerously, it breaks down completely when confronted by enemies. A people who treat a hostile group that does not share their universalist values with the same consideration they give their own citizens will be swiftly conquered. Universalism only appears to work in highly prosperous, secure societies that are living off the inherited capital of a past built on more realistic loyalties.

Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility is the realistic perspective to these unworkable extremes. It acknowledges the truth of our self-anchored nature but builds upon it a structure of expanding obligation that aligns responsibility with knowledge and efficacy. You have the most detailed knowledge of how to help your own family, so your primary responsibility lies there. You are most effective at improving your own community, so that is your next sphere of action. This system creates a strong, organic society from the bottom up: healthy individuals create healthy families, healthy families create prosperous communities, and healthy communities create a resilient nation.

The practical battleground where these philosophies collide is the question of national borders. A nation is a home for a people, a distinct tier of responsibility. A nation’s border is the boundary of that home. Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility argues for secure borders as a prerequisite for national sovereignty and community cohesion, while demanding humane, symmetrical treatment of individuals within those borders. Its rivals seek to dissolve these borders through different forms of universalist logic.

One form uses decontextualized religious ethics. A common tactic is to present a verse like Leviticus 19:34, "you shall love the alien as yourself", and imply that this command for face-to-face kindness to a foreigner *residing with you* is a divine mandate for a specific national policy of open borders. This is proof-texting via insinuation. It conflates a moral duty to an individual immigrant with the political question of a nation’s immigration policy. Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility, by contrast, applies the principle correctly within its tiers: we must treat the lawful alien in our community with dignity and fairness (Procedural Symmetry), while simultaneously upholding the nation’s right and responsibility to control its borders to protect the well-being of its citizens.

Another form of universalism comes from libertarianism. Anarcho-capitalists argue for no borders at all, proposing a world of private property where landowners decide who may enter. This ignores a fundamental reality of law. A nation’s laws are not arbitrary; they are the result of a people’s shared values and history, a generational expression of Procedural Symmetry. A system of laws requires a people who have bought into it. To dissolve the nation is to dissolve the basis of the law itself. Minarchist libertarians, meanwhile, often advocate for open borders based on abstract free-market principles, arguing for the free movement of labor to maximize global economic efficiency. This prioritizes a fictional "global citizen" over the concrete citizens of the nation. While economic principles are tools, their purpose within the PO framework must be to benefit the people of the nation enacting them, not a theoretical "global well-being."

The most aggressive modern assault on borders comes from a progressive ideology rooted in critical theory. This view argues that national borders are illegitimate scars of "settler-colonialism." Enforcing these borders is seen as an act of ongoing oppression. The call to action is for "no borders, no nations," justified as a form of reparative justice. This is radical universalism framed as anti-colonialism. Its goal is the complete dissolution of the nation-state, a foundational tier of responsibility, to absolve a historical guilt. It demands that a nation abandon its right to self-preservation and its duty to its own citizens in favor of an abstract global penance.

These universalist approaches are deeply irresponsible. They demand we neglect the primary tiers of responsibility in favor of the outermost, most abstract tier. Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility rejects this. It champions a world of concentric loyalties, a system that is both deeply human and profoundly effective. While you prioritize the well-being of your own family and community, you must insist that the public rules of the society, the laws of the land, apply equally to your group and to every other group. Your loyalty is to your people; your allegiance is to the fair procedure that governs all peoples.
