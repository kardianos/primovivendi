# Part III: Contrasting Procedural Objectivism

## Chapter 13: Contrasting Symmetry

To truly understand a philosophy, one must understand not only what it asserts, but also what it rejects. Over the next chapters, we will place Procedural Objectivism in direct contrast with conflicting philosophies. This process will sharpen the edges of our definitions and make clear the practical, real-world consequences of choosing one philosophical path over another. We begin with the concept of justice, which every society must define. At the heart of any theory of justice lies a chosen form of "symmetry", a principle that determines what a fair and balanced social interaction looks like. The choice of which symmetry to value is one of the most consequential a society can make.

The first major rival is Value Symmetry, a principle of justice based on retribution. Its core belief is that fairness is achieved when a perpetrator receives a punishment of equal value to the harm they inflicted. This is the ancient logic of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." We must first acknowledge its appeal. It speaks to a primal human desire for retribution and the balancing of scales. And historically, it served a crucial purpose: it acted as a *limit*. In a world where the natural human impulse might be to seek vengeance ten times greater than the original offense, "an eye for an eye" puts a cap on the cycle of revenge. It says, "this much, and no more."

In parts of the west, historically Value Symmetry has been called *Lex Talionis* and restricted the amount of retribution that could be exacted. In the modern world the only places Value Symmetry is encoded into law in the notion of Qisas, an aspect of Islamic Sharia Law, in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan. It allows the victim or the victim's family exact equal amount of bodily harm or to be paid some amount of money to compensate for the value of the crime. Procedural Objectivism rejects Value Symmetry as a basis for a modern legal system. It is fundamentally backward-looking, focused on settling a past grievance rather than building a stable future. Its application is often subjective and inflammatory, how does one precisely measure the "value" of a lost reputation or a lifetime of trauma? And it too often leads to escalating cycles of vendetta, destabilizing the very social order it aims to protect. Justice, in Procedural Objectivism, should be about restoring order and upholding a fair process, not about the meticulous infliction of equal harm. That being said, Procedural Objectivism does not directly reject corporal punishments, such as the use of Caning in Singapore, so long as it is given as a violation of the law in a prescribed manner, and not as a retribution of value.

The second, more modern rival is Outcome Symmetry, the core principle of egalitarianism. This is the belief that justice is achieved only when all individuals in a society have the same, or roughly the same, outcomes in terms of wealth, status, and well-being. The moral appeal of this vision is powerful; it is born from a sincere and compassionate desire to eliminate poverty and suffering. Who would not want a world where no one is left behind?

The goal of Outcome Symmetry is not equality of opportunity, but equality of outcome, often called "equity". Equity, in this context, is the unequal treatment of individuals to correct for unequal group results. It requires constant intervention by a central authority to rebalance outcomes, as free people will never produce identical results. This worldview is defined by its focus on group identity over individual action. An individual is seen not as a sovereign actor, but primarily as a representative of their identity group (defined by race, class, etc.). The unit of moral analysis shifts from the individual to the group average. Individual merit, choices, and culpability become secondary to the statistical outcomes of the group to which one belongs.

In the courtroom, society can be seen as a conspirator against the perpetrator, either forcing or assisting in the crime. The modern intellectual framework that employs this logic is known as Critical Theory. This single framework has given rise to numerous fields of study and activism. Examples of Critical Theory today includes, but is not limited to:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 1. Critical Race Theory | 11. Critical Animal Studies |
| 2. Critical Legal Studies | 12. Critical Geopolitics |
| 3. Feminist Theory | 13. Critical Media Studies |
| 4. Queer Theory | 14. Critical Psychiatry |
| 5. Postcolonial Theory | 15. Mad Pride |
| 6. Critical Disability Theory | 16. Critical Information Studies |
| 7. Fat Studies | 17. Critical Urban Theory |
| 8. Critical Pedagogy | 18. Settler Colonial Studies |
| 9. Critical Whiteness Studies | 19. Critical Data Studies |
| 10. Critical Management Studies | 20. Intersectionality |

The core error of this view is its misinterpretation of difference as injustice. While Procedural Symmetry would always see injustice when the wealthy are subject to one set of laws and the poor are subject to a different set of laws, Outcome Symmetry would only see injustice in this situation if such laws didn't favor the poor (the oppressed) against the wealthy (the oppressor), thus requiring unequal procedures.

Procedural Symmetry stands in stark contrast to both Value Symmetry and Outcome Symmetry. It states that justice is found not in the result, but in the fairness of the game. Everyone, from the richest to the poorest, must play by the same set of rules, be judged by the same impartial laws. It works *with* human nature by allowing individuals to benefit from their own efforts, thus encouraging the very productivity and innovation that elevates the standard of living for everyone. It is the only form of justice compatible with a free, prosperous, and virtuous society.

The practical implications of this choice are immense. In a courtroom, the Value Symmetry advocate wants to exact equal retribution. The Outcome Symmetry advocate wants to blame the crime on socioeconomic forces. The Procedural Symmetry advocate wants to know one thing: did the accused violate a clear law, as determined by a fair and standard procedure? In a classroom, the Outcome Symmetry advocate may seek to eliminate advanced classes to ensure no student feels "behind" and no one "gets ahead" and to force equal outcomes, effectively holding back the brightest. The Procedural Symmetry advocate insists that every student has access to quality instruction and is held to the same high academic standards, allowing each to achieve their own level of excellence. The symmetry a society chooses determines whether it will be a society of vengeance, a society of enforced mediocrity, or a society of opportunity. Procedural Objectivism unequivocally chooses the latter.
