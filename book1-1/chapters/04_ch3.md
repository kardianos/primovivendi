## Chapter 3: Limited, Selfish, and Not Naturally Good

We are humans who pursue truth. Humans are fundamentally limited and selfish.

Recognizing that humans are limited is sometimes called the “constrained vision” of humanity. It acknowledges that wisdom lies in designing systems and ethics that work *within* our inherent limitations, rather than pretending they don’t exist.

These limits are woven into our being. Our time is finite, forcing us to make choices and accept trade-offs. Our bodies and minds are finite, requiring rest and succumbing to biases. Our knowledge is finite, a tiny island in a vast ocean of complexity. Our perspective is finite, anchored in a single body at a single point in time. We always operate on incomplete information from a narrow point of view.

This stands in stark contrast to the “unconstrained vision,” the seductive but dangerous belief that human flaws are merely products of corrupt external systems. The unconstrained vision assumes human potential is nearly infinite and can be perfected if only we create the right society. This logic is a trap. If human evil is caused by a flawed society, then the path to creating a “New Man” is to perfect society, by force if necessary. As with Lysenko, who believed he could re-educate nature itself, this utopian dream consistently ends in totalitarian nightmare.

Accepting our limitations is not cause for despair. On the contrary, limitation is the mother of all meaningful structure.

Recognizing humans are selfish is not a moral judgment. Human selfishness means an individual’s primary, instinctual driver is their own survival and well-being, and the well-being of those closest to them (kin selection). Our consciousness is anchored in a single self; our concerns naturally radiate outward from that point. Anyone who did not prioritize their own survival and replication is, by definition, not our ancestor. This is not a prescriptive claim about how we *should* act, but a descriptive claim about how we are *wired*.

This does not mean you should only act for yourself. Not at all. We only observe that human nature is oriented around the self, and any workable ethic must account for this to channel it. This is the logic behind checks and balances in government and prosperous market economies. A wise system does not rely on finding benevolent leaders; it creates a structure where, as James Madison argued, “ambition must be made to counteract ambition,” and where, as Adam Smith noted, the butcher provides our dinner not from benevolence, but from regard to his own interest. Well-designed systems align individual self-interest with the common good.

Lastly, humans in a state of nature, or directly upon being born, are not angelic beings only capable of good. Goodness must be taught. Virtue, kindness, and self-control are not factory settings; they are skills painstakingly learned over a lifetime. We need only look at a young child to see this truth. A toddler is a bundle of pure, unconstrained self-interest. They must be taught, over many years, to be kind, honest, and respectful. Goodness is the product of this long, difficult process of civilization.

This view opposes the romantic fantasy of the “noble savage,” an idea associated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He argued that humans are born good and pure, but are corrupted by society. In this view, the path to a better human is to perfect society by removing its bad elements. If we create a flawless social environment, it will produce flawless people.

We posit the exact opposite. Man starts out selfish and savage. It is society (its laws, traditions, and institutions) that civilizes him and provides the structure for his goodness to grow. Our aim is not to violently tear down and rebuild society to force a new humanity into existence, but to patiently cultivate what is good within what we actually have.

Reality is real and consequential. Truth is knowable, but humans are limited, we are often wrong. Be humble.
