## Chapter 2: Truth, Knowing What Is

Truth is what corresponds to reality.

There is no relative truth. There is no “your truth” and no “my truth.” What is true is what corresponds to reality.

Truth is knowable because reality is knowable.

To say truth is “knowable” is not to say it is “infallibly known.” Our knowledge is, and always will be, provisional and subject to revision. We can be wrong. But our fallibility does not negate the possibility of knowledge; it means we must remember we can be wrong or gain more precise knowledge in the future. Knowing we may be wrong does not mean we should change our minds about anything at any time. Reality’s consequences take time to observe; do not be swayed by claims without evidence of their outcomes.


We understand the world through interfaces, our senses, that translate external states into internal signals. For truth to be knowable, these interfaces need not provide perfect or identical subjective experiences. They must provide something more fundamental: consistent, discriminative feedback.

* Consistent: knowing reality requires our senses must be generally consistent with themselves. The frequency your eyes said was green yesterday should generally be the same today.
* Discriminative: knowing reality requires our senses to be able to discriminate between two different inputs. For instance to see both green and purple your eyes need to be able to be sensitive enough to send different signals on different inputs. For things we can't directly sense, such as infra-red or x-rays, we can build machines that translate these aspects of reality that we can't naturally discriminate and into ones we can.

The philosophical objection "How do I know your experience of 'purple' is the same as mine?" misses the point. Truth is not determined by comparing inner experiences. It is determined by correlating discriminable states of the interface with states of the world.

The prerequisite for discovering truth is not shared subjectivity, but a discriminative interface that yields consistent, correlatable data. This functional requirement is what allows truth to be pursued and known across vast differences in perception.

Again, truth is what corresponds to reality. A statement is true if it accurately describes a state in the real world. While true beliefs do “work,” this is a *feature* of truth, not its definition. An engineer’s belief in aerodynamics works, resulting in a plane that flies, precisely *because* his belief corresponds to reality. Because reality is objective, truth must also be objective. It is discovered, not created. The law of gravity was true long before Newton described it and Einstein refined it.

Our *knowledge* of reality can be incomplete or imprecise, but the underlying reality is definite. The goal of seeking truth is to better understand reality.

Because reality is consequential, truth, as its reflection, is also consequential. The truth, “Jumping off this cliff will lead to death,” has immediate consequences. Every great advance in human well-being results from discovering a truth about reality and putting it to work.

Consider Trofim Lysenko, the Soviet agronomist who rejected genetics as “bourgeois pseudoscience.” He promoted the falsehood that plants could be “re-educated” to pass improved traits to their offspring. Based on the Marxist ideal that there is no “intra-class struggle,” he forced farmers to plant seeds in dense clusters, believing they would cooperate rather than compete. He ordered seeds soaked in freezing water to “teach” them cold-hardiness. When imposed as state policy, these doctrines defied biological reality and contributed to horrific famines. Reality delivered its feedback not in a debate, but in empty fields and the deaths of millions. Ideas have consequences because ideas are claims about what is true.

When seeking truth, we must be careful of our models. Sometimes models work because they accurately represent reality. Sometimes they work because their methods align with reality, even if their stated justifications are inaccurate. Ptolemaic astronomy placed Earth at the center of the solar system and used complex mathematics to approximate planetary positions. It generally predicted positions for the wrong reasons.

When correcting methods that work in practice but lack accurate justification, do not just rip them out. Provide an alternative justification, possibly with simpler or more precise principles, and test this correction over time. Copernicus’s heliocentric model provided a simpler concept that matched Ptolemy’s accuracy. Kepler revised it further, turning circles into ellipses, removing epicycles, and simplifying motion into three laws. These men sought not to tear down, but to better understand and describe reality.

Truth is indifferent to our feelings. Therefore, we must value truth even when it is uncomfortable. The painful truth that a business is failing or a relationship is broken is the necessary first step toward a solution. To prefer a comforting lie is to choose eventual catastrophic failure over the immediate pain of reality.

The pursuit of truth is not a destination but a constant process of alignment. We must apply the same scrutiny to all ideas. The same critical standards we use to tear down a flawed idea must be applied with equal rigor to our new, favored hypothesis. We cannot be harsh critics of others’ beliefs and gentle protectors of our own. This symmetry guards against bias and ensures we are moving closer to truth, not just swapping one dogma for another.

The pursuit of truth, then, is a moral imperative. This entire procedure, however, is carried out by limited human beings.
