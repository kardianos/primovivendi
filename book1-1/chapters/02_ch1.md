# Part I: Core Principles

## Chapter 1: Reality is Real, Truth is Knowable

The first axiom is fundamental: **Reality is real, knowable, and consequential.**

There is a hierarchy: existence has primacy over consciousness. We must exist before we can perceive. This is not merely philosophical but functional. The human mind does not spring fully formed from a void; it develops through interaction with a pre-existing reality. As documented in tragic cases of severe childhood neglect, a mind deprived of the raw material of reality (objects, language, other people) cannot learn to think properly. We must first exist within the world before our consciousness can begin to order it and put it into words. Consciousness is a faculty for apprehending reality, not for creating it.

Reality operates independently of our hopes and feelings. A dropped ball falls regardless of your thoughts or social status. Reality is also consequential. An entire society could declare that fire is cold, write it into law, and teach it in schools, but the first child who touches a flame will still be burned. A bridge built on flawed physics will collapse; a business based on fantasy will fail. Reality does not debate; it provides feedback, often brutally.

Many of our most important social systems are not arbitrary constructions but necessary consequences that emerge to solve problems posed by reality. Money, for example, is a tool that naturally arises from the reality of human specialization and the need for a common medium of exchange. Its form may be conventional (shells, gold, data) but its function is a discovery. Likewise, social prohibitions against murder and theft are consequences of the reality that a cooperative society cannot survive if its members engage in indiscriminate, internal violence. These are not mere “social constructs”; they are discovered solutions to real-world constraints.

Domains like biology, mathematics, and history are discovered features of reality, not inventions. The names and terminology we assign to them are conventions for communication, but the underlying truths (such as the function of a cell, the relationship between prime numbers, the existence of the Roman Empire) are not. For our communication to be effective, these words and definitions must remain stable. To arbitrarily redefine words is to degrade the one tool we have for building a shared understanding of our shared world.

Reason is a powerful tool. It can reduce the number of things we must test when solving problems. But reason untethered to reality is equivalent to hallucination.

Reality is knowable, but that knowing can vary in accuracy (how close your understanding is to reality) and precision (how much detail it can describe). Reality is not progressive. It does not proceed at all. Human understanding of reality, however, can over time more accurately describe what exists.

There is only a single reality, and everyone shares it.
