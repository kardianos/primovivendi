## Chapter 5: Tiered, Self-Anchored Responsibility

Responsibility is the behavior capable of creating and maintaining. In a specialized society, we often trade our ability to create and maintain for the abilities of others.

Each person’s responsibility starts with themselves: creating our own lives and shaping our future for the better, for our own continuance. This could be as simple as sweeping your floor, or as complex as working to secure food.

Our responsibility does not end with ourselves, but it begins there. Our responsibility for ourselves is the greatest.

Responsibility for others radiates outward from ourselves in decreasing measure. We have significant responsibility for our spouse and children, but less than for ourselves, and more than for our neighbors. We owe a more generic duty to our fellow countrymen. For those outside our country who do not share our laws, we have a broad human responsibility, but less still.

We must also recognize enemies. If a country or group states they want to abolish or kill your nation, they are your enemy. Failing to recognize this is dangerous and suicidal.

Humans are limited. Each person has finite hours in a day. We cannot know what each person needs or what is good for them. Thinking everyone has the same outlook or needs, or that you can know everyone, is not humble.

I reject the notion that each person should be considered the same. This is prideful. This is sometimes called Universalism, and it should be rejected.

I reject with disgust the idea that you should care for “big things” like “everyone on earth” or “strangers on a different continent” more than yourself or your family. This is sometimes called radical altruism, and it should be rejected.
