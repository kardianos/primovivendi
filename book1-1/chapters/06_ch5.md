## Chapter 5: What Must be Good

So what do we, these flawed, limited beings who are not naturally good, strive to be? What is this goodness we should seek?

What we consider good must include: **human life should continue and continue well, both generationally and individually.**

The first part is that life should “continue.” This speaks to both individual survival and, crucially, to generational survival. The core component of goodness is the act of having and raising the next generation, of passing the gift of life forward. A good life is not lived only for the moment; it contributes to the great, ongoing chain of humanity.

The second part, “and continue well,” elevates this philosophy beyond mere animal survival. It is not enough just to exist; the goal is to flourish. “Living well” is the pursuit of quality, health, prosperity, and purpose. This clause prevents the axiom from justifying a grim “survival at any cost” mentality. It affirms that the *quality* of our lives is a profound moral concern.

“Living well,” however, is not a destination. It is not a utopia. There is no point at which one can say, “I have now arrived at the state of ‘living well.’” Rather, living well is a *vector*, a direction, not a location. It is measured by the positive slope between two points in time.

Goodness is like keeping your floor clean. At Time 1, the floor is dirty. It dirties your feet, which dirties your bedsheets. This is a small friction, a minor impediment to living well. You then take responsibility and sweep the floor. At Time 2, the floor is clean, your feet are clean, and your sheets stay clean. The slope between Time 1 and Time 2 is positive. This small act of imposing order on chaos *is* the process of living well in microcosm.

This concept is universally applicable. A prisoner can seek to live well within his constraints by keeping his space clean, exercising, and reading to improve his mind. A billionaire can seek to live well by managing resources responsibly and creating value for others. The specific actions differ, but the underlying principle is the same: to take ownership of one’s circumstances and act to make them better. Living well is the constant, active process of moving from a state of lesser order, health, and purpose to a state of greater order, health, and purpose.

With this axiom, we have a clearer standard for judgment. To evaluate any action, system, or idea, we can ask: On balance, and over the long term, does this contribute to or detract from humans living and continuing well?

Consider theft. For the victim, theft is clearly “not good,” as it diminishes their resources and ability to live well. A thief may see a short-term gain, but they endorse a principle that, if universalized, would make their own life insecure. It erodes the social trust and stability necessary for *any* member of society to flourish. We can judge theft to be objectively bad according to our standard.

Because reality is consequential and because we have a fixed criterion for judgment, we can make objective statements about what is good. The statement, “All other things being equal, it is better to rest one’s hand on a soft pillow than on a hot flame,” is not a matter of subjective opinion. It is an objectively true statement about what contributes to a human being’s physical well-being. Goodness, in this view, is not a mysterious metaphysical property; it is a measure of an action’s alignment with the flourishing of life.

Because we are limited beings, our understanding of what will *ultimately* produce goodness is always imperfect. We can be wrong. The world is complex, and the long-term consequences of our actions are not always clear. The pursuit of the good must always be undertaken with humility, with a constant willingness to check our ideas against real-world outcomes and adjust our course when the evidence demands it.
