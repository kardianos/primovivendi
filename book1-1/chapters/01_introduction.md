# Introduction

Procedural Objectivism is a worldview focused on a productive way to live and live together.

*   Reality is real, consequential, and knowable. Truth is what corresponds to reality.
*   Humans are limited and selfish.
*   Goodness, at minimum on this earth, is that human life should continue and continue well.
*   Our responsibility in this moral realm begins with ourselves and our family, radiating outward in decreasing measure to our community, region, and nation.
*   The foundational perspective beyond ourselves is procedural symmetry: we bind ourselves to the same procedures we demand of others.

Procedural Objectivism is not a new religion, a blended philosophy, or an amalgamation. It fully respects that the “why” behind a Christian’s worldview and an atheist’s are fundamentally different and irreconcilable. It operates, instead, on a proven principle: incompatible beliefs do not prevent cooperation on the practical “how” of building a society.

Most importantly, these are not separate points, but each must be viewed in light of the others.
