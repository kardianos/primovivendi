## Part VI: The Crossroads - PO in Contrast

## Chapter 13: Symmetry Showdown: Procedural vs. Value and Outcome

*   **Section 1: The Centrality of a Society's "Symmetry" (10 paragraphs)**
    1.  **[P1: The Importance of Comparison]** Begin by stating that a philosophy is best understood by what it rejects. The next few chapters will place PO in direct dialogue with its main rivals to clarify its unique stance.
    2.  **[P2: The Concept of Social Symmetry]** Introduce the idea that every theory of justice is based on a chosen form of "symmetry"—a principle that determines what a "fair" or "balanced" social interaction looks like. The choice of symmetry is one of the most fundamental choices a society can make.
    3.  **[P3: Three Competing Symmetries]** Re-introduce the three main forms of symmetry from the outline that societies can value: Value Symmetry, Outcome Symmetry, and Procedural Symmetry. This chapter will put them head-to-head.
    4.  **[P4: The Test for a Good Symmetry]** Propose the criteria for judging these symmetries. A good system of justice should: a) align with the goal of "living and living well," b) be stable over the long term, and c) work with, not against, the realities of human nature (limited and self-interested).
    5.  **[P5: Value Symmetry: "An Eye for an Eye"]** Formally define Value Symmetry: the belief that justice is achieved when a perpetrator receives a punishment of equal value to the harm they inflicted. This is the logic of retribution. Its most famous expression, "an eye for an eye," is often misunderstood as barbaric, but it must be acknowledged that it also functions as a crucial *limit*. In a world where the natural human impulse can be to seek vengeance that is ten times the original offense, "an eye for an eye" puts a cap on retribution. It says "this much, and no more."
    6.  **[P6: The Appeal of Value Symmetry]** Acknowledge its appeal. It feels viscerally fair and satisfies a primal human desire for retribution. It seems to perfectly "balance the scales."
    7.  **[P7: The Failure of Value Symmetry]** Argue that it fails in practice. It often leads to endless, escalating cycles of vendetta and revenge, destabilizing society. How do you precisely measure the "value" of an insult or a lost limb? Its application is often subjective and inflammatory.
    8.  **[P8: Mercy in Value Symmetry]** Explain mercy in this system, as per the outline: "to charge the perpetrator less than what their actions cost." Mercy is a discount on the retribution owed.
    9.  **[P9: Why PO Rejects Value Symmetry]** Conclude that PO rejects it because it is backward-looking (focused on retribution for the past) rather than forward-looking (focused on creating a stable future) and it fails the test of long-term stability.
    10. **[P10: Setting up the Next Rival]** Introduce the next, more modern competitor: Outcome Symmetry.

*   **Section 2: The Utopian Dream of Outcome Symmetry (15 paragraphs)**
    11. **[P11: Defining Outcome Symmetry]** Formally define Outcome Symmetry: the belief that justice is achieved only when all individuals in a society have the same (or roughly the same) outcomes in terms of wealth, status, and well-being. This is the core principle of egalitarianism.
    12. **[P12: The Moral Appeal of Outcome Symmetry]** Acknowledge its powerful moral appeal. It is born from a compassionate desire to eliminate suffering and inequality. The vision of a world with no poverty or disparity is a powerful one.
    13. **[P13: The Fundamental Flaw 1: It Denies Reality]** Argue that Outcome Symmetry is based on a denial of reality. Individuals are not the same. They have different talents, different work ethics, different preferences, and they encounter different circumstances. Forcing equal outcomes requires treating unequal people, unequal efforts, and unequal situations unequally. It punishes virtue and rewards vice in the name of an artificial equality.
    14. **[P14: The Sports Analogy Revisited]** Use the sports analogy again. To ensure every game ends in a 0-0 tie (outcome symmetry), the referee would have to constantly penalize the stronger team. Procedural Objectivism acknowledges that teams start with different strengths, and individuals face different circumstances. But unlike many sports games, most of life is not zero-sum. The goal is not for one person to "win" at another's expense. It is perfectly fine for one person to become wealthy through excellent work while another lives a more modest but still good life. Outcome symmetry wrongly frames this natural diversity of results as an injustice that must be "corrected."
    15. **[P15: The Fundamental Flaw 2: It Requires Totalitarian Power]** Argue that since people, if left free, will naturally produce unequal outcomes, the only way to maintain outcome symmetry is through a massively powerful centralized state that constantly intervenes to redistribute resources and control individual choices.
    16. **[P16: The Problem of Incentives]** Outcome symmetry destroys the incentive to work hard, innovate, and take risks. If your extra effort will be taken from you and the rewards of another's idleness will be given to them, the rational choice is to do less. This leads to universal poverty, not universal wealth.
    17. **[P17: The Impossibility of Mercy]** Use the crucial insight from the outline: "Mercy in 'outcome symmetry' cannot exist, because anything less than equal outcomes is an ongoing injustice." The system has no room for grace or discretion; its logic demands constant, coercive leveling.
    18. **[P18: The Judgment of Envy]** Argue that Outcome Symmetry is often powered by the emotion of envy, dressed up in the language of justice. It focuses not on raising the poor, but on tearing down the successful.
    19. **[P19: The "Living Well" Test]** Judge this system against the axiom of goodness. By destroying incentives and requiring coercion, it ultimately lowers the standard of living for everyone and violates the principle of "living well."
    20. **[P20: Why PO Rejects Outcome Symmetry]** Conclude that PO rejects Outcome Symmetry because it is at war with human nature, it is destructive to prosperity, and it is incompatible with individual liberty. It is a utopian dream that becomes a dystopian nightmare in reality.
    21. **[P21: Acknowledging the Problem of Disparity]** Acknowledge that vast disparities of wealth can be a problem for social cohesion. However, the PO solution is not to enforce equal outcomes, but to ensure the procedures for success are fair and accessible to all, and to foster a culture of tiered responsibility and charity.
    22. **[P22: The Transition to PO's Solution]** Having shown the failures of both retribution-based and equality-based justice, the stage is set for a fuller defense of PO's alternative.
    23. **[P23: Recapping Procedural Symmetry]** Briefly restate the definition of Procedural Symmetry: everyone is subject to the same rules and processes. Justice lies in the fairness of the game, not the final score.
    24. **[P24: Why it is Superior]** Argue for its superiority based on the established criteria. It works *with* human nature (channels self-interest). It is stable and forward-looking. It allows for the freedom and diversity that lead to a prosperous society where people can "live well."
    25. **[P25: Mercy in Procedural Symmetry]** Re-explain mercy in this system: "discretionary clemency enacted for what is ethically good, even if it goes against the law." It is a flexible, humanizing element that can be applied wisely, unlike the rigid logic of the other two systems.

*   **Section 3: The Practical Implications of the Choice (15 paragraphs)**
    26. **[P26: In the Courtroom]** Contrast how each symmetry would approach a criminal trial. Value symmetry would focus on making the criminal suffer. Outcome symmetry might focus on the criminal's socioeconomic background as the "real" cause. Procedural symmetry would focus on one question: Did the accused violate the law, as determined by a fair and standard procedure?
    27. **[P27: In the Classroom]** Contrast how each symmetry would approach education. Value symmetry is irrelevant. Outcome symmetry would lead to policies that try to ensure every student gets the same grade. To achieve this, schools might abolish grades, eliminate advanced or honors classes to avoid making some students feel "behind," and hold back faster students to allow slower students to keep pace. The focus shifts from individual achievement to collective leveling. Procedural symmetry would insist that every student has access to quality instruction and is judged by the same academic standards, allowing each to rise to their own level of excellence.
    28. **[P28: In the Economy]** Contrast their economic approaches. Outcome symmetry leads to socialism/communism, with massive redistribution and state control. Procedural symmetry leads to a free market economy regulated by the rule of law, where everyone has the right to enter the market and succeed or fail based on their merits.
    29. **[P29: The Impact on Individual Responsibility]** Value symmetry demands personal vengeance. Outcome symmetry dissolves personal responsibility into collective guilt. Procedural symmetry is the only system that firmly upholds individual responsibility for one's actions.
    30. **[P30: The Language of Justice]** Analyze the language used by advocates of each system. Outcome symmetry advocates talk about "equity," "social justice," and "systemic" issues. Procedural symmetry advocates talk about "equality before the law," "equal opportunity," and "due process."
    31. **[P31: Choosing a Society]** Frame the choice for the reader. The kind of society you live in—its freedom, its prosperity, its sense of justice—depends directly on which of these symmetries it chooses to value.
    32. **[P32: Procedural Symmetry's Imperfection]** Reiterate that Procedural Symmetry is not perfect. The procedures are administered by flawed humans. But it is the *best possible system* for managing social life among limited, self-interested beings.
    33. **[P33: The Fight for Procedural Symmetry]** Argue that the fight to create, maintain, and defend procedural symmetry is one of the most important political and cultural battles in any society.
    34. **[P34: A Call to Clarity]** Urge the reader to be clear about which form of symmetry they are actually advocating for when they discuss issues of justice. Vague calls for "fairness" are not enough.
    35. **[P35: Chapter Summary]** Summarize the chapter's showdown. Value symmetry is too primitive. Outcome symmetry is a destructive utopian fantasy. Procedural symmetry is the only system of justice that is realistic, stable, and conducive to a free and prosperous society where individuals can live and live well.
