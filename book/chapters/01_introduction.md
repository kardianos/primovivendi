# Introduction

We navigate our social and political world with the cardinal directions of liberal-conservative, religious-atheist. These cardinal distinctions have meaning. But in today's social and political landscape on earth, I propose there are five positions that are more consequential to how citizens envision and shape society.

Religions and philosophies seek to answer the "why" of our existence. This book, however, focuses on the "how" of a society, proposing five fundamental axes that shape it. When you overlay those "why" beliefs onto these "how" axes, distinct clusters of thought emerge. One particular cluster corresponds to a coherent set of principles that this book aims to isolate and define. We call this framework Procedural Objectivism.

At first glance, the beliefs that fall within the cluster of Procedural Objectivism don't seem to belong together. There are theists, such as some strains of Christians and Jews, and there are atheists, such as some who call themselves classical liberals. But many other Christians are more strongly grouped with a different group, such as progressive liberals. In other words, there are Christians grouped in the Procedural Objectivism cluster and other Christians in polar opposite positions. The same goes for those who call themselves liberal. So we ask ourselves, what is going on here?

To do so we will name and describe these five axial positions:

*   **The Nature of Reality:** Is reality an objective, knowable thing that exists independently of our minds? Or is it a "construction" of society, power, or divine revelation?
*   **The Nature of Humanity:** Are humans fundamentally limited, selfish, and not naturally good? Or are we blank slates, or inherently noble beings corrupted by society?
*   **The Foundation of Goodness:** By what standard do we judge an action to be "good"? What is our ultimate, non-arbitrary moral axiom?
*   **The Principle of Justice:** What does a "fair" society look like? Should it ensure everyone plays by the same *procedures*, receives tit-for-tat *value* in exchanges, or achieves equal *outcomes*?
*   **The Scope of Responsibility:** To whom do we owe our care and limited resources? Do our duties radiate outward from the self in tiers, or should we be universalists who care for everyone equally?

Procedural Objectivism is not a belief system, it isn't even what would normally pass as a philosophy. Rather it is a particular set of positions along these axes that is observed to overlap with existing religions and philosophies that I believe to be self-congruent, self-reinforcing, and overall beneficial to building a good society.

Procedural Objectivism aims to describe a position that already exists, a common ground for realists. We will spend the majority of time describing what Procedural Objectivism is positively. When we contrast Procedural Objectivism with conflicting positions, it is to put bounds on what it is not, not to fully and carefully describe different contrary positions. Procedural Objectivism offers a coherent naming and descriptions of compatible positions:

*   It begins with **Objectivism**, the non-negotiable principle that an objective reality exists, and that truth is the discovery of what corresponds to it, and that truth is knowable.
*   It takes a realistic view of **Human Nature**, positing that we are limited, selfish, and not naturally good. A philosophy must be built for the beings we are, not the angels we wish to be.
*   To bridge the gap from what *is* to what *ought to be*, it proposes a foundational **Axiom of Goodness**: that human life should continue and continue well.
*   From this, it derives the engine of a just society: **Procedural Symmetry**, which focuses on fair processes over equal outcomes.
*   It organizes our duties with **Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility**, a practical guide for ordering our loyalties in a world of finite resources.

To be clear, Procedural Objectivism is not a new religion or a blended philosophy. It fully respects that the "why" behind a Christian's worldview and an atheist's are fundamentally different and irreconcilable. It operates, instead, on a proven principle: incompatible beliefs do not prevent cooperation on the practical "how" of building a society. This is the very foundation of the American experiment. Theists and atheists can vote in the same election and accept its outcome because they agree on a shared procedure, even while disagreeing on ultimate truth. In this sense, this book is not inventing a radical concept; it is simply giving a name to a principle that already works.

So if these principles are not new, why do they need a name now? Because the common ground they create is shrinking. Across the West, totalizing ideologies, both religious and secular, are on the rise. Their defining feature is not just their incompatibility, but their refusal to engage in reasoned debate or seek common cause. They demand surrender, not agreement. This book defines Procedural Objectivism to offer a clear alternative: a framework that builds bridges through reality and reason, and in doing so, exposes the beliefs and philosophies that would burn them down.
