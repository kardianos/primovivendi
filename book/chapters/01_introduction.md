# Introduction

We navigate our social and political world with the cardinal directions of liberal-conservative, religious-atheist. These cardinal distinctions have meaning. But in today's social and political landscape on earth, I propose there are five positions that are more consequential to how citizens envision and shape society.

When you overlay the religions and philosophical believes that answer "why", over where they fall along the five proposed axis that talk about the "how" of a society, a distinct set of clusters emerge. One such cluster of beliefs hover over a set of principles we pick out in this book and aim to define. I call it Procedural Objectivism.

One of the first things you notice in the beliefs which overlay the cluster of principles I call Procedural Objectivism is that don't look like they should go together. There are theists, such as some strains of Christians and Jews, and there are atheists, such as some who call themselves classical liberals. But many other Christians are more strongly grouped with a different group, such as progressive liberals. In other words, there are Christians grouped in the Procedural Objectivism cluster and other Christians in polar opposite positions. The same goes for those who call themselves liberal. So we ask ourselves, what is going on here?

To do so we will name and describe these five axial positions:

*   **The Nature of Reality:** Is reality an objective, knowable thing that exists independently of our minds? Or is it a "construction" of society, power, or divine revelation?
*   **The Nature of Humanity:** Are humans fundamentally limited, self-anchored, and not naturally good? Or are we blank slates, or inherently noble beings corrupted by society?
*   **The Foundation of Goodness:** By what standard do we judge an action to be "good"? What is our ultimate, non-arbitrary moral axiom?
*   **The Principle of Justice:** What does a "fair" society look like? Should it ensure everyone plays by the same *procedures*, receives tit-for-tat *value* in exchanges, or achieves equal *outcomes*?
*   **The Scope of Responsibility:** To whom do we owe our care and limited resources? Do our duties radiate outward from the self in tiers, or should we be universalists who care for everyone equally?

Procedural Objectivism is not a belief system, it isn't even what would normally pass as a philosophy. Rather it is a particular set of positions along these axis that is observed to overlap with existing religions and philosophies that I believe to be self-congruent, self-reinforcing, and overall beneficial to building a good society.

Procedural Objectivism aims to describe a position that already exists, a common ground for realists. We will spend the majority of time describing what Procedural Objectivism is positively. When we contrast Procedural Objectivism with conflicting positions, it is to put bounds on what it is not, not to fully and carefully describe different contrary positions. Procedural Objectivism offers a coherent naming and descriptions of compatible positions:


*   It begins with **Objectivism**, the non-negotiable principle that an objective reality exists, and that truth is the discovery of what corresponds to it, and that truth is knowable.
*   It takes a realistic view of **Human Nature**, positing that we are limited, self-anchored, and not naturally good. A philosophy must be built for the beings we are, not the angels we wish to be.
*   To bridge the gap from what *is* to what *ought to be*, it proposes a foundational **Axiom of Goodness**: that human life should continue and continue well.
*   From this, it derives the engine of a just society: **Procedural Symmetry**, which focuses on fair processes over equal outcomes.
*   It organizes our duties with **Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility**, a practical guide for ordering our loyalties in a world of finite resources.


Nothing in this book should be taken as an attempt to create a synthesized single religion or philosophy. The differences in the underlying why of various beliefs compatible with Procedural Objectivism are fundamentally incompatible and these differences are real and meaningful. However different incompatible beliefs don't prevent some agreement along some fundamental social lines. If that were not possible the USA's constitution containing freedom of religion would be unworkable and would result in a continuous power struggle. In practice today, many theists and atheists both vote and embrace peaceful changes of power. So what this book proposes is not anything new.

If it is not anything new, why define a set of principles? Why try to define Procedural Objectivism?

In the USA today, and in fact many parts of The West, there is a rising tide of beliefs which are genuinely incompatible with each other. Some of these beliefs are atheistic. Others are theistic. Not only are these beliefs raising in influence, they also generally lack methods to challenge them or allow a common ground between them. They are totalizing. Procedural Objectivism is a set of principles which have a method of finding common ground and reason and highlighting those beliefs which do not.
