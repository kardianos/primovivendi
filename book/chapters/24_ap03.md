## On Social Constructivism

The discussion of social constructivism in earlier chapters may have appeared overly stark. However, this book does not intend to engage deeply with social constructivism on its own terms. The reason is fundamental: Procedural Objectivism operates from a different philosophical foundation altogether. This section aims to clarify that foundation, explaining why the very framing of social constructivism is rejected and how a realist perspective better accounts for both individual agency and societal function.

Like free will, regardless of its ultimate metaphysical reality, we must act as if we possess it. The practical necessity of assuming agency, of holding individuals responsible for their choices, remains paramount. Similarly, even if human behavior is profoundly shaped by social environment, it is essential to act as if individuals retain agency. This is not a denial of influence; it is a recognition that individual accountability is itself a primary tool of positive social influence. A society that penalizes bad behavior is a society that can influence individuals to choose a better path, even those from the most difficult backgrounds. To excuse bad behavior because of social influence is to remove the very feedback mechanism that can counteract it.

This pragmatic stance does not mean that context is irrelevant when determining action or administering justice. When someone commits a crime, their background, mental state, and social circumstances are always relevant factors. Yet, the fundamental question remains: are they capable, in this moment, of understanding and adhering to societal laws? A plea of insanity or a demonstration of malice both address this current state of capability. Crucially, this holds true whether the root cause is deemed biological, psychological, or social. The plea "I couldn't help it because of my upbringing" is functionally equivalent to "I couldn't help it because of my brain chemistry" when it comes to assessing present responsibility. Both acknowledge a present inability to conform to societal expectations, regardless of origin.

History provides powerful counterpoints to the notion that social forces are entirely determining. Even during times of overt, institutionalized oppression like slavery and rampant racism, individuals like Harriet Tubman chose paths of resistance, self-determination, and action for the betterment of life. Their very existence demonstrates that the human capacity for agentic behavior, working to make life "continue and continue well", persists even under the most constraining social constructs. Their actions were not merely "different"; they were assertions of agency against overwhelming social pressure to the contrary.

This is where social constructivism often masquerades as empathy. It claims that behavior is shaped by environment, history, or systemic forces, a claim that contains partial truth but leads to a dangerous conclusion: that individuals are not truly responsible for their actions until society is "fixed." This is the implicit, and perilous, implication that full moral accountability must await the achievement of a perfect, deconstructed society, a utopia free of all oppressive structures. This is a profound error. The demand for perfection before responsibility is a recipe for perpetual irresponsibility and societal decay. Each individual, born into an inherently unequal world, must strive to rise from their starting point towards their goals. This is not callousness; it is the only realistic path forward. Simultaneously, this recognition of individual striving does not negate society's concurrent obligation to identify and dismantle overt, identifiable structural barriers, bad laws, explicit prejudices, and institutionalized discrimination. These are obstacles that can be addressed through collective action and reform.

Even the most basic elements often labeled as social constructs reveal discovered necessities rooted in reality. Consider language. The specific word "cat" is indeed a social convention, varying across cultures. However, the *need* for consistent labels to facilitate communication is not constructed; it is discovered. Without shared understanding of terms, communication collapses. The label is the construct; the necessity for shared meaning is a feature of reality. The same applies to money. While the specific form, Dollar, Yen, Bitcoin, is a social implementation, the underlying *function*, a medium of exchange for specialized labor in complex societies, is a discovery of a real economic need. Money is a placeholder in a ledger of value, a tool that reflects, rather than creates, the reality of trade-offs and specialization.

This perspective fundamentally rejects the framing that society itself is merely a social construct. Yes, societies make different choices and face real trade-offs. Different cultures develop distinct practices, laws, and customs. This variation is real and significant. But this recognition of difference is absolutely distinct from believing that the very *possibility* and *necessity* of organized human society is a mere social fiction. Societies exist because humans, as social beings facing shared realities, must organize to survive and thrive. The specific forms they take are influenced by history, geography, and culture, but their fundamental function, organizing human interaction within the constraints of objective reality, is not constructed, it is discovered.

This leads to a crucial distinction: objective standards and the nature of failure. When a youth refuses to study and subsequently fails an exam, they are not simply expressing a "different way of being." They have objectively failed to meet the demands placed upon them by the educational system, which itself reflects societal needs for competence. This is failure relative to an objective standard, not mere difference. So too with societies. When a society acts in ways demonstrably out of alignment with the demands of reality, whether economic, biological, or social, it experiences negative consequences. This is not just "different"; it is objectively poor performance, a failure to meet the demands of existence.

This difference in perspective stems from a fundamental disagreement about the very nature of truth and reality. Procedural Objectivism asserts that goodness, truth, and reality are positive phenomena that can be known and understood on their own terms. We can measure light, its wavelength, its intensity, its effects, without any reference to darkness. Darkness is not a co-equal force to be studied; it is the absence of light. Likewise, truth is a positive correspondence to what is. Falsehood is a lack, a corruption, or a negation of that truth. We do not need evil to define goodness.

Dialectical Social Constructivism, the most common form of constructivism, says that things can only be understood through conflict with their opposites. Procedural Objectivism rejects this conflict-based framing. The consequences of this view are not abstract. In the social sphere, it gives rise to ideologies like a certain strain of modern anti-racism that defines itself purely through a perpetual struggle against "racism." A positive state of racial harmony becomes philosophically impossible, seen only as a form of "complicity" in an unseen struggle. The conflict becomes the goal. In the theological sphere, it produces frameworks like Liberation Theology, which reinterprets faith not as a positive relationship with God, but as a historical process of struggle against oppression. The Gospel ceases to be a map to salvation and becomes a manual for earthly revolution.

This way of constructivist thinking creates a sealed intellectual system. It claims access to a special, hidden knowledge of the "true" forces driving history. Any criticism from an outsider is dismissed as a product of ignorance or "false consciousness." Crucially, any failure of the theory in practice is never seen as a flaw in the theory itself, but is reinterpreted from within as a "betrayal," an "impure application," or the work of counter-revolutionaries. The system is perfectly insulated from any falsifying evidence from reality. (This structure is a classic example of a hermetic, gnostic argument, which is fundamentally a system of faith.) Procedural Objectivism does not attempt to debate such a system on its own terms; to do so is fruitless. To enter the sealed room is to implicitly accept its premises. Instead, we offer a better alternative: an open system based on correspondence to a shared, testable reality, which invites evidence and judges ideas by their real-world consequences.
