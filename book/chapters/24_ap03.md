## On Social Constructivism

The discussion of social constructivism in earlier chapters may have appeared overly stark. It's a complex topic, often misunderstood or oversimplified. However, this book does not intend to engage deeply with social constructivism on its own terms. The reason is fundamental: Procedural Objectivism operates from a different philosophical foundation altogether. This section aims to clarify that foundation, explaining why the very framing of social constructivism is rejected and how a realist perspective better accounts for both individual agency and societal function.

Like free will, regardless of its ultimate metaphysical reality, we must act as if we possess it. The practical necessity of assuming agency, of holding individuals responsible for their choices, remains paramount. Similarly, even if some human behavior is profoundly shaped by social environment, it remains essential to act as if individuals retain agency. This is not denial of influence; it is recognition of necessity. Without assuming agency, concepts of moral responsibility, legal accountability, and personal growth become incoherent. A society that ceases to act on the assumption of individual choice ceases to function as a society of moral agents.

This pragmatic stance does not mean that context is irrelevant when determining action or administering justice. When someone commits a crime, their background, mental state, and social circumstances are always relevant factors. Yet, the fundamental question remains: are they capable, in this moment, of understanding and adhering to societal laws? A plea of insanity or a demonstration of malice both address this current state of capability. Crucially, this holds true whether the root cause is deemed biological, psychological, or social. The plea "I couldn't help it because of my upbringing" is functionally equivalent to "I couldn't help it because of my brain chemistry" when it comes to assessing present responsibility. Both acknowledge a present inability to conform to societal expectations, regardless of origin.

History provides powerful counterpoints to the notion that social forces are entirely determining. Even during times of overt, institutionalized oppression like slavery and rampant racism, individuals like Harriet Tubman chose paths of resistance, self-determination, and action for the betterment of life. Their very existence demonstrates that the human capacity for agentic behavior, working to make life "continue and continue well", persists even under the most constraining social constructs. Their actions were not merely "different"; they were assertions of agency against overwhelming social pressure to the contrary.

Social constructivism often carries the implicit, and dangerous, implication that full moral accountability must await the achievement of a perfect, deconstructed society, a utopia free of all oppressive structures. This is a profound error. The demand for perfection before responsibility is a recipe for perpetual irresponsibility and societal decay. Each individual, born into an inherently unequal world, must strive to rise from their starting point towards their goals. This is not callousness; it is the only realistic path forward. Simultaneously, this recognition of individual striving does not negate society's concurrent obligation to identify and dismantle overt, identifiable structural barriers, bad laws, explicit prejudices, institutionalized discrimination. These are obstacles that can be addressed through collective action and reform.

Even the most basic elements often labeled as social constructs reveal discovered necessities rooted in reality. Consider language. The specific word "cat" is indeed a social convention, varying across cultures. However, the *need* for consistent labels to facilitate communication is not constructed; it is discovered. Without shared understanding of terms, communication collapses. The label is the construct; the necessity for shared meaning is a feature of reality. The same applies to money. While the specific form, Dollar, Yen, Bitcoin, is a social implementation, the underlying *function*, a medium of exchange for specialized labor in complex societies, is a discovery of a real economic need. Money is a placeholder in a ledger of value, a tool that reflects, rather than creates, the reality of trade-offs and specialization.

This perspective fundamentally rejects the framing that society itself is merely a social construct. Yes, societies make different choices and face real trade-offs. Different cultures develop distinct practices, laws, and customs. This variation is real and significant. But this recognition of difference is absolutely distinct from believing that the very *possibility* and *necessity* of organized human society is a mere social fiction. Societies exist because humans, as social beings facing shared realities, must organize to survive and thrive. The specific forms they take are influenced by history, geography, and culture, but their fundamental function, organizing human interaction within the constraints of objective reality, is not constructed, it is discovered.

This leads to a crucial distinction: objective standards and the nature of failure. When a youth refuses to study and subsequently fails an exam, they are not simply expressing a "different way of being." They have objectively failed to meet the demands placed upon them by the educational system, which itself reflects societal needs for competence. This is failure relative to an objective standard, not mere difference. So too with societies. When a society acts in ways demonstrably out of alignment with the demands of reality, whether economic, biological, or social, it experiences negative consequences. This is not just "different"; it is objectively poor performance, a failure to meet the demands of existence.

Therefore, Procedural Objectivism operates from a realist stance that acknowledges the profound interplay between individual agency and social influence, without collapsing into either naive individualism or deterministic social constructionism. It recognizes that individuals possess practical agency and are accountable for their actions from their unequal starting points. It recognizes that societies are complex systems that make real choices with real consequences. It insists that both individuals and societies are ultimately answerable to the feedback provided by reality itself. To frame this relationship primarily through the lens of social construction is to begin from a premise that obscures more than it illuminates, denying the discovered necessities and objective constraints that govern both human action and social organization.
