## Chapter 18: The Community and the Workplace

Beyond the walls of the home, the primary arena where an individual engages with the wider community is the workplace. It is a system for voluntary cooperation and the creation of value. A Procedural Objectivist approach can make this sphere of life more productive, fair, and rewarding for everyone involved.

We can revisit Sarah, now an employee at a large company. She approaches her job not as a place to “find her passion” or as a surrogate family, but as a professional commitment. She understands it as a clear contract: she provides her focused effort and skill, executed with excellence, in exchange for fair compensation. This compensation, in turn, allows her to fulfill her primary responsibilities to her own family. Her duty as an employee is to take ownership of her tasks and to be a responsible steward of the company’s resources and time.

When faced with a common workplace challenge, such as a colleague trying to shift blame for a failed project, she does not resort to emotional reactions or office gossip. She applies the principles. First, she aligns with truth, calmly and factually documenting the sequence of events and her specific contributions. Second, she presents this reality to her superiors, focusing on the objective facts of the project, not on a personal attack against her colleague. She exercises judgment about the situation without becoming “judgmental” in the negative, emotional sense. She trusts that a fair procedure, based on evidence, will lead to a just outcome.

Now let us look from the employer’s perspective, through the eyes of David, a small business owner who tries to run his company on PO principles. The axiom of goodness for his business is clear: “long-term profitability, achieved by providing excellent value to customers and maintaining a fair and productive environment for employees.” This standard guides his decisions.

When hiring, David uses procedural symmetry. Every candidate for a given role is asked the same core questions and evaluated against the same rubric of skills and character. This is not just a defense against bias; it is the most effective method for identifying the most competent person, which best serves his goal of building a profitable and excellent company.

When an employee is underperforming, David takes responsibility as a manager. He judges that the poor performance is “not good” for the health of the company. His response is procedural and proportional, not emotional. He meets with the employee, presents the objective facts of their performance shortfalls, and places them on a formal Performance Improvement Plan with clear, measurable goals. He makes it clear that either the performance must rise to the required standard, or they are not a good fit for the role. If the employee improves, the process worked. If they do not, the decision to let them go is not a shocking, angry event, but the logical and expected conclusion of a fair and documented procedure.

Beyond the workplace, the responsible individual acts as a citizen within their community. Consider Maria, a teacher who lives in the same town. She practices tiered responsibility. She first ensures her own home and family are well-cared for. Then, she extends her sense of ownership to her immediate surroundings. When she sees the local park becoming littered and run-down, she doesn’t just complain to the city council. She takes the first, smallest responsible action: she picks up a bag of trash herself. This act of leadership through example inspires others, and soon she has organized a monthly neighborhood cleanup day. She has taken ownership of a small piece of her community and made it more beautiful.

When the city council proposes a complex new regulation that could harm local businesses like David's, Maria and David analyze it through the PO lens. Does the proposed law apply equally to all, or does it contain special favors for connected insiders? Will it, according to a realistic assessment of its consequences, help the town to “live well,” or will it stifle the small businesses that are its economic lifeblood? At the town hall meeting, Maria does not make emotional appeals; she presents a clear, reality-based argument about the foreseeable negative effects of the law. A PO citizen is an active and engaged citizen, applying the principles of ownership, judgment, and procedural symmetry to build a better world from the bottom up.
