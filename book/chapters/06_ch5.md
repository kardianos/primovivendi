## Chapter 5: Procedural Symmetry: The Engine of a Just Society

We stand at a critical juncture. We have a moral destination, a world where human life continues and flourishes. We have a realistic understanding of the travelers, limited, self-anchored individuals. The great political and ethical problem is how to get a large group of such people to cooperate toward that common goal without descending into either the chaos of anarchy or the iron fist of tyranny.

One simple answer is force. A powerful ruler can, through coercion and fear, compel his subjects to cooperate. But this fails our standard of "living well." A life governed by the constant threat of violence is a life of fear, anxiety, and suppressed potential. It is mere existence, not flourishing. The subjects of a tyrant do not innovate, they do not speak freely, and they do not trust one another. Coercion can produce a semblance of order, but it can never produce a good society.

Another simple answer is to simply hope for the best, to rely on the innate benevolence of humanity. This approach fails our test of realism. A society built on the assumption that millions of self-interested strangers will spontaneously act for the collective good is a society built on a fantasy. As we have established, goodness is an achievement, not a default state. To base a social order on the expectation of selfless altruism from all is to build a house of cards in a hurricane.

The challenge is to design a *system*, a set of rules for interaction that works *with* the grain of human nature, not against it, to produce prosocial outcomes. The system must be able to generate trust and predictability among strangers who do not share bonds of kinship or personal affection. It must be a game in which the self-interested action of each player contributes, as if by an invisible hand, to a better outcome for all. It is important to note that such a system can only function effectively among a people who already share the foundational value of wanting humans to live and live well. It is a method for cooperation among people of goodwill, not a magic formula for converting enemies into friends.

So, what is a rule that a group of self-interested yet reasonable people could all agree to live by to secure their own well-being and protect themselves from the depredations of others? This line of thinking inevitably leads to some version of what is known as the Golden Rule, an ethical insight discovered by cultures all over the world. It is expressed in the positive form as, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It is also famously expressed in its prohibitive negative form by the sage Hillel the Elder: "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow." Both formulations contain the same profound, revolutionary idea: the only fair rule is a symmetrical one. This is the seed of Procedural Symmetry.

Procedural Symmetry is the core social principle of Procedural Objectivism. It states that each person in a society must live under the same procedures as everyone else. The rules, the laws, and the methods of judgment must be applied equally to all, regardless of their wealth or status. Its active form is a command for how we must engage with the world: Judge others, and the ideas they present, by the same rigorous and fair procedure by which you would want to be judged.

The key to this principle is that it harnesses the engine of self-interest to generate fairness. To secure my own long-term interests and protect myself from the arbitrary power of others, I must advocate for a system that gives the same procedural protections to everyone. I want a law against theft to be applied universally, so that my own property is safe. I want the procedures for a fair trial to be available to all, because I might one day be the one who is accused. I agree to bind myself by the same rules that bind others, because a world of consistent rules is safer and more prosperous for me in the long run than a world where rules can be bent at will. Mutual self-interest, when channeled through the demand for procedural symmetry, becomes the unlikely author of justice.

The most important application of this is the Rule of Law. In a just society, the law against assault protects the weak and the strong alike. The procedures for enforcing a contract are the same for the rich corporation and the small craftsman. A wealthy man who commits a crime must be judged by the same court procedures as a poor man. The law, in its majestic equality, must be no respecter of persons.

This principle extends to the marketplace. The rule should be: if you show up, do good work, and create value, you will be compensated. This is not a guarantee of a specific salary, but a promise that the *process* of evaluation and reward is open to all who are willing to make the effort. It allows for unequal outcomes, and in fact, it necessitates them, but it insists that those outcomes are reached through a fair and transparent process.

It is crucial to understand what Procedural Symmetry is not. It is not "value symmetry," the retributive justice of "an eye for an eye." Value Symmetry at best limits retribution to like for like harm. However, the system that is focused on inflicting equal harm, and often leads to endless, escalating cycles of revenge. Procedural Symmetry is forward-looking; its goal is to maintain a stable and peaceful social order for the future.

Even more importantly, Procedural Symmetry is the polar opposite of "outcome symmetry," the egalitarian belief that a just society is one where everyone has the same things. Procedural Objectivism roundly rejects this goal. Individuals are born with different talents, develop different work ethics, and encounter different circumstances. A system that attempts to force equal outcomes must, by definition, treat people unequally. It must take from the productive to give to the unproductive; it must hold back the swift to accommodate the slow. To use a sports analogy, outcome symmetry demands that every game end in a tie. Procedural symmetry demands only that everyone plays by the same rules and that the referee is impartial, allowing the best team to win. Acknowledging that individuals face different circumstances and start with different strengths does not change this. Unlike many sports, most of life is not a zero-sum game. It is perfectly just for one person to become wealthy through brilliant and difficult work, while another lives a more modest but equally dignified life. Procedural symmetry creates a system where everyone can prosper to the best of their abilities, not a system that guarantees everyone an identical result.

In the real world, of course, these procedures are administered by flawed human beings, so their application will always be imperfect. Justice and rewards will never be distributed with perfect fairness. The goal of a good society is not to achieve an impossible perfection, but to make the application of its procedures *as symmetrical as possible*, and to have clear avenues of appeal for when the system fails. We strive for the ideal, knowing we will always fall short, because the striving itself is what bends the arc of a society toward justice.

This principle is a universal tool, useful far beyond the design of social systems. In scientific inquiry, procedural symmetry demands that a new, fashionable theory be subjected to the same harsh, critical standards as the old theory it seeks to replace. You cannot use one set of rules to demolish your opponent's argument and a more lenient set to build up your own. In logic, a valid argument form must hold true regardless of the content plugged into it. The consistent, symmetrical application of standards is the very bedrock of reason.

We can use procedural symmetry as a powerful test to vet proposed ethical rules. Consider the popular maxim "love everyone," if it is interpreted as a command to act with equal care toward all. This sounds noble, but it fails the test. Because humans are limited in time and resources, it is an *impossible procedure*. To even attempt to love a stranger's child with the same practical commitment you show your own is to fail both of them. A procedure that cannot be followed by real humans is not a good procedure. Contrast this with the rule, "Prioritize the well-being of your own spouse and children." Let's test this with procedural symmetry. If I follow this rule, my family is cared for. If my neighbor follows it, their family is cared for. When universalized, this procedure creates a society of strong, resilient, well-cared-for families. It works *with* the grain of our self-anchored nature to produce a good outcome. It is a sound and workable procedure.

We must always remember the crucial addendum: Judge others, but *do judge*. Procedural symmetry is not a call for moral passivity or a refusal to make distinctions. It is the opposite. It is a demand for constant, active, and *fair* judgment. Without the willingness to judge that a procedure has been violated, the rules become meaningless, and the social order dissolves. Goodness withers when it is not protected by fair judgment.

This principle of symmetry is not just for the present moment; it must be extended across time. What procedure do we wish our ancestors had followed with respect to us? The answer is clear: we wish they had worked to provide us with life itself, and with the knowledge and resources to live that life well. Therefore, by the law of procedural symmetry, we owe the same to the next generation. This is our generational obligation: to reproduce the life and goodness we ourselves have received. It is applying the Golden Rule across time. Just as we were given life by our parents, we have a duty to create the next generation. Just as we inherited a world of immense technological, cultural, and political capital, we have a duty to be good stewards of that inheritance and pass it on, ideally enhanced, to our descendants. This is not just a nice idea; it is a profound moral imperative. To consume the resources of the present with no thought for the future is to violate procedural symmetry in its grandest application.

In summary, Procedural Symmetry is the master principle of social organization in Procedural Objectivism. It is the social contract agreed to by a society of self-interested individuals who understand that the fairest and most stable system is one where everyone, from the most powerful to the most humble, is subject to the same set of rules. Extended over time, it becomes a sacred obligation to future generations. It is the engine that, when properly maintained, can power a just, prosperous, and durable civilization.
