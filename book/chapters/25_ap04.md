## On Jesus

The social and ethical instructions of Jesus of Nazareth are often misinterpreted as a sentimental call for universal altruism and non-judgment. This view is a profound misreading. His teachings, when examined for their internal structure and applied logic, form a coherent and realistic framework for how a fallible individual should live. This framework is not a political program for the state, but a rigorous, personal guide built upon symmetrical procedure, prioritized responsibility, and the necessity of judgment.

The master principle of Jesus’s ethical system is procedural symmetry. He states it plainly: "In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 7:12). This is not a suggestion for a general feeling of goodwill; it is a clear, universal procedure for testing the morality of any action. You must be willing to be subject to the same standard you apply to others.

This demand for consistent procedure extends to the very act of interaction within a community. The Apostle James, applying the teachings of the Master, directly condemns favoritism within the assembly. He warns against granting special honor to the wealthy while demeaning the poor: "My brothers, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, ‘You sit here in a good place,’ and you say to the poor man, ‘You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,’ have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?" (James 2:1-4). James demands that the procedure of welcome and respect be applied equally, regardless of an individual’s external status. He does not call for the wealthy to divest their riches to make outcomes equal; he calls for the equal application of dignity and impartiality within the communal space.

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant is a stark illustration of the consequences of violating this principle. A man is forgiven an insurmountable debt by his king, an act of supreme mercy. He has had a procedure of grace applied to him. He then immediately finds a man who owes him a trivial sum and, refusing to apply the same procedure of mercy, has him thrown into prison. The servant’s error was not his initial debt, but his procedural hypocrisy. His final, severe punishment from the king is the direct and just consequence of this violation of symmetry (Matthew 18:23-35).

This principle extends to final judgment. In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, the separation is based on a consistent procedure of action. The question is how one treated "the least of these brothers of Mine." Those who fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and visited the prisoner are judged to have done so to the Lord himself. The standard is symmetrical: one’s treatment of the lowest tier of society is taken as one’s treatment of the highest. The judgment is based not on feeling, but on a consistent record of right action (Matthew 25:31-46).

This demand for righteous procedure necessitates judgment. The common refrain to "judge not" is a fragment, ripped from its context. The full command is a condemnation of *hypocritical* judgment: "Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? … You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye" (Matthew 7:3-5). This is not a prohibition of judgment, but a prerequisite for it. One must first take responsibility and apply judgment to oneself. Only then can one judge others with the clarity and authority required.

Jesus himself was not non-judgmental. He was a master of discernment. He openly condemned the scribes and Pharisees as a "brood of vipers" and "whitewashed tombs," a sharp and public judgment of their character (Matthew 23:33, 27). His mercy was always paired with a demand for responsibility. To the woman caught in adultery, he offers protection from her accusers but immediately commands, "Go, and from now on sin no more" (John 8:11). Mercy is extended, but it is not permissiveness. It is a bridge to a better life, contingent on the individual’s choice to abandon their destructive actions.

Jesus’s ethics also reject universalism in favor of a clear, tiered structure of responsibility. This is demonstrated in his response to two distinct situations. The Parable of the Good Samaritan defines our reactive duty when confronted with a crisis. An expert in the Law asks, "And who is my neighbor?" seeking to define the limits of his obligation. Jesus tells the story of a man left "half dead" on the road. A priest and a Levite pass by, refusing to take responsibility. A Samaritan, a member of a despised out-group, stops. He acts because a life is in immediate danger. His intervention is a direct fulfillment of the foundational principle that life should continue. Jesus re-frames the question from "Who *is* my neighbor?" to "Which of these...*proved to be a neighbor*?" (Luke 10:29, 36). The answer is found in the responsible deed. This parable is not a call for universalism; it is a condemnation of using rules to evade responsibility in the face of a life-or-death emergency.

This principle of reactive duty is balanced by a clear understanding of proactive, tiered priorities. The anointing at Bethany illustrates this. When his disciples object that the expensive perfume used on him could have been sold and the money given to the poor, they are making a universalist argument. Jesus rebukes them directly: "For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me" (Matthew 26:11). He establishes an undeniable hierarchy of duty. The immediate, specific, and high-tier obligation to him, in that moment, takes precedence over the general and abstract obligation to the poor.

While Jesus’s own words often focused on the ultimate priority of his divine mission, the task of building sustainable, righteous communities required his followers to apply these principles to the practicalities of household and civic life. The Apostle Paul, in his pastoral instructions, makes this hierarchy of responsibility explicit and non-negotiable. He writes that if "anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever" (1 Timothy 5:8). This is a bright line. The duty to one’s own household is a foundational, non-negotiable tier of responsibility, a prerequisite for a credible faith.

This structure clarifies the command to "love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44). This love is not a call for sentimental affection; the Greek word used, agape, signifies a disciplined love of the will. It is a chosen disposition of goodwill, not a passive feeling. Jesus provides the specific, non-material action this love requires: to "pray for those who persecute you." The command is not to provide for your enemy as you would your family, but to hold them in a posture of principled non-malice before God.

This distinction is crucial when understanding enemies in their civic context. A clear example is the Roman soldier who, by law, could compel a Jewish citizen to carry his pack for one mile. Jesus’s instruction to "go with him two miles" (Matthew 5:41) is a strategy for this reality. The first mile is an act of compulsion; the second mile is an act of principled choice. This is a strategy for navigating conflict within a shared social order, not a suicide pact in the face of annihilation. Scripture makes a clear distinction between this kind of civic enemy and an existential enemy, such as those Gideon fought, who would murder and destroy. The response to such a threat was not to turn the other cheek, but to defend one’s people.

Jesus himself established clear boundaries. He instructed his disciples, "If anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet" (Matthew 10:14). There is no infinite obligation to invest one’s limited time and energy in those who are hostile.

Finally, the prerequisite for any engagement with Jesus was humility. He did not engage with those who believed they were already good. His time was for those who knew they were flawed: "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Mark 2:17). This is a profound recognition that goodness is not our default state. Acknowledging one's own flawed nature is the first step toward a moral life.

The social teachings of Jesus, therefore, are not a collection of sentimental ideals. They form a cohesive and practical framework for life. This framework is built upon the master principle of procedural symmetry, a clear-eyed demand for non-hypocritical judgment, a realistic hierarchy of prioritized responsibilities, and firm boundaries against those who are hostile. It is not a program for utopia. It is a guide for how a flawed individual, humbly aware of their own nature, can take responsibility and live a good and honorable life in a fallen world.
