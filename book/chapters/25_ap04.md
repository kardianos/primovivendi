## On Jesus

The social and ethical instructions of Jesus of Nazareth are often misinterpreted as a sentimental call for universal altruism and non-judgment. This view is a profound misreading. His teachings, when examined for their internal structure and applied logic, form a coherent and realistic framework for how a fallible individual should live. This framework is not a political program for the state, but a rigorous, personal guide built upon symmetrical procedure, prioritized responsibility, and the necessity of judgment.

The master principle of Jesus’s ethical system is procedural symmetry. He states it plainly: "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets." This is not a suggestion for a general feeling of goodwill; it is a clear, universal procedure for testing the morality of any action. You must be willing to be subject to the same standard you apply to others.

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant is a stark illustration of the consequences of violating this principle. A man is forgiven an insurmountable debt by his king, an act of supreme mercy. He has had a procedure of grace applied to him. He then immediately finds a man who owes him a trivial sum and, refusing to apply the same procedure of mercy, has him thrown into prison. The servant’s error was not his initial debt, but his procedural hypocrisy. He demanded one standard for himself and applied a different, harsher standard to another. His final, severe punishment from the king is the direct and just consequence of this violation of symmetry.

This principle extends to final judgment. In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, the separation is based on a consistent procedure of action. The question is how one treated "the least of these." Those who fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and visited the prisoner are judged to have done so to the Lord himself. The standard is symmetrical: one’s treatment of the lowest tier of society is taken as one’s treatment of the highest. The judgment is based not on feeling, but on a consistent record of right action.

This demand for righteous procedure necessitates judgment. The common refrain to "judge not" is a fragment, ripped from its context. The full command is a condemnation of *hypocritical* judgment: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own? First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye." This is not a prohibition of judgment, but a prerequisite for it. One must first take responsibility and apply judgment to oneself. Only then can one judge others with the clarity and authority required.

Jesus himself was not non-judgmental. He was a master of discernment. He openly condemned the scribes and Pharisees as a "brood of vipers" and "whitewashed tombs," a sharp and public judgment of their character. His mercy was always paired with a demand for responsibility. To the woman caught in adultery, he offers protection from her accusers but immediately commands, "Go now and leave your life of sin." Mercy is extended, but it is not permissiveness. It is a bridge to a better life, contingent on the individual’s choice to abandon their destructive actions.

Jesus’s ethics also reject universalism in favor of a clear, tiered structure of responsibility. This is demonstrated most powerfully at the anointing at Bethany. When his disciples object that the expensive perfume used on him could have been sold and the money given to the poor, they are making a universalist, altruistic argument. Jesus rebukes them directly: "The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me." He establishes an undeniable hierarchy of duty. The immediate, specific, and high-tier obligation to him, in that moment, takes precedence over the general and abstract obligation to the poor.

This structure clarifies the command to "love your enemies." This was not a command to treat an existential threat as one would treat a brother. The enemies in this context were civic and personal antagonists, the Roman soldier who could compel a Jew to carry his pack for a mile, the tax collector, the rival in a lawsuit. These were people within a shared, if adversarial, social order. To "love" them was to apply the Golden Rule: to not wish them ill, to act with honor, and to go the extra mile, thereby upholding one’s own integrity. It was a strategy for navigating conflict within a society, not a suicide pact in the face of annihilation.

Scripture makes a clear distinction between this kind of civic enemy and an existential enemy. The enemies Gideon fought were not rivals within a system; they were foreign invaders who would murder, rape, and destroy. The response to such a threat was not to turn the other cheek, but to take up the sword in defense of one’s people, family, and land. The Bible is not naive about the reality of evil that must be fought.

Jesus himself established clear boundaries. He instructed his disciples, "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet." There is no infinite obligation to invest one’s limited time and energy in those who are hostile or reject the message. One must judge when to engage and when to walk away.

Finally, the prerequisite for any engagement with Jesus was humility. He did not engage with those who believed they were already good. His harshest words were for the self-righteous. His time was for those who knew they were flawed: tax collectors, prostitutes, soldiers, sinners who understood their own selfish and limited nature. He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. This is a profound recognition that goodness is not our default state. Acknowledging one's own flawed nature is the first step toward a moral life.

The social teachings of Jesus, therefore, are not a collection of sentimental ideals. They form a cohesive and practical framework for life. This framework is built upon the master principle of procedural symmetry, a clear-eyed demand for non-hypocritical judgment, a realistic hierarchy of prioritized responsibilities, and firm boundaries against those who are hostile. It is not a program for utopia. It is a guide for how a flawed individual, humbly aware of their own nature, can take responsibility and live a good and honorable life in a fallen world.
