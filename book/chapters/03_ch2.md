## Chapter 2: Truth, Knowing What Is

If a real and independent world exists, the most urgent question becomes: can we know it? Procedural Objectivism answers with a confident yes. Truth, because it corresponds to a consistent and ordered reality, is knowable by the human mind.

To say that truth is "knowable" is not to say it is "infallibly known." This distinction is important. Our knowledge is, and always will be, provisional and subject to revision. We can be wrong. But the fact that we are fallible does not negate the possibility of knowledge; it just means we must keep in mind that we can be wrong or gain a more precise knowledge of reality in the future. Knowing that we may be wrong also doesn't mean we should change our minds about anything at anytime. Don't be so open minded that your brain falls out. Understanding what is true takes time as seeing consequences of reality takes time.

We understand the world through proxies, such as our senses like our eyes and ears. Their general consistency allows us to navigate our environment with remarkable success. The objection, "How do I know your 'purple' is the same as my 'purple'?" is irrelevant to knowable truth. It doesn't matter if our subjective sensations differ. What matters is that we both consistently distinguish the color labeled "purple" from "green." This shared distinction is an objective, actionable truth.

This is powerfully demonstrated by modern AI. A person sees a cat with biological eyes; a machine "sees" it by processing pixel data. The mechanisms are alien to one another, yet both can arrive at the same propositional truth about the world. While the label we use ("cat") is a convention, the category it points to, the object's distinct and consistent set of features, is a real and knowable aspect of reality. The fact that such different systems can identify the same objective category proves that our ability to form mental models is predicated on a reality consistent enough to be understood. We do not need to experience absolute darkness to measure the properties of light; knowledge can be established through consistent measurement and reason.

With the knowledge that truth is knowable, we can define it. Specifically, Procedural Objectivism holds that **truth is what corresponds to reality**. A statement is true if it accurately describes a state of affairs in the real world. While true beliefs do "work," this is a *feature* of truth, not its definition. An engineer's belief in aerodynamics works, resulting in a plane that flies, precisely *because* his belief corresponds to reality.

Because reality is objective, truth must also be objective. It is discovered, not created. The law of gravity was true long before Newton described it.

Truth is also singular. A claim is either true or it is not. The cat is either on the mat or it isn't. Our *knowledge* of this can be incomplete or imprecise, our map may be low-resolution, but the underlying territory is definite. The goal of inquiry is to improve the resolution of the map, bringing it into ever-sharper correspondence with the landscape of reality.

Because reality is consequential, truth, as its reflection, is also profoundly consequential. The truth, "Jumping off this cliff will lead to death," has immediate consequences that are immune to our opinions. Every great advance in human well-being is the result of discovering a truth about reality and putting it to work. Conversely, the greatest evils in history were the logical consequence of people acting on beliefs that were terrifyingly false.

Consider the tragic case of Trofim Lysenko, the Soviet agronomist who rejected not only the established science of genetics as "bourgeois pseudoscience," but also the hard-won practical knowledge of farmers. He promoted the politically convenient falsehood that plants, like good Soviet citizens, could be "re-educated" and pass their new, improved traits directly to their offspring. This ideology led to disastrous mandates. Based on the Marxist ideal that there is no "intra-class struggle," he forced farmers to plant seeds in dense clusters, believing they would cooperate rather than compete. He ordered seeds to be soaked in freezing water, claiming this would "teach" them cold-hardiness. When these doctrines were imposed as state policy, they defied the biological reality of how plants grow and contributed to horrific famines in the Soviet Union and China. Reality delivered its feedback not in a debate, but in empty fields and the deaths of millions. Ideas have consequences because ideas are claims about what is true.

Truth is indifferent to our feelings. Therefore, we must value truth even when it is uncomfortable. The painful truth that a business is failing or a relationship is broken is the necessary first step toward fixing the problem. To prefer a comforting lie is to choose eventual catastrophic failure over the immediate pain of reality. This is why we must reject the "noble lie." It is an act of profound arrogance, assuming one can outsmart the cascading consequences of reality. The path to a good society is paved with hard truths.

The pursuit of truth is not a destination but a constant process of alignment. We test our mental maps against the territory of reality and refine them based on the feedback we receive.

In this process we must apply the same scrutiny and truth inspection processes to different ideas. The same critical standards we use to tear down a flawed idea must be applied with equal rigor to our new, favored hypothesis. We cannot be harsh critics of others' beliefs and gentle protectors of our own. This symmetry disciplined guards against bias and ensures we are moving closer to the truth, not just swapping one dogma for another.

The pursuit of truth, then, is a moral imperative. It is the challenging and rewarding work of holding a clear mirror up to the face of the world. It is essential for navigating reality, especially given the subject of our next chapter: the limited, fallible, and self-interested nature of the beings holding the mirror.

We have established that reality is knowable, allowing us to define truth simply and powerfully as that which corresponds to what is. This direct link makes truth not an academic game, but a matter of profound consequence. The pursuit of it must therefore be a humble and ongoing process, a commitment to continually refine our understanding by applying the same standards to all ideas, especially our own. Crucially, we must never allow our abstract theories to overrule the feedback from reality itself. This entire procedure of knowing truth, however, is carried out by a limited human beings and to understand our chances of success, we must first understand the limited, fallible, and self-interested nature of the truth-seeker.
