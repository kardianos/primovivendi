## Chapter 14: Reality vs. Constructivism

Procedural Objectivism faces its most profound challenge from constructivism, a family of philosophies that denies the objective, consequential nature of reality. By asserting that "truth" is merely willed into existence by society, divinity, or power, constructivism liquefies the ground beneath our feet, rendering responsibilities arbitrary, love illusory, enemies negotiable, and forgiveness a meaningless gesture in a world without fixed wrongs. This chapter defines constructivism, shows how its variants cluster while differing in scope and danger, and refutes it through reason, evidence, and the unyielding feedback of reality itself.

Not all constructivism is identical, but its variants cluster around the denial of direct access to objective truth, instead positing an intermediary authority that "constructs" knowledge. Divine constructivism locates this authority in revelation from God, deeming the observable world fallen or illusory. Social constructivism, meanwhile, attributes truth to cultural, societal, or power-driven narratives, varying from mild observations about conventions to radical claims that dismantle all norms. These cluster in their rejection of humility before reality, promoting instead an arrogant will to reshape the world, but they differ: divine forms often preserve some imposed moral structure, while extreme social variants slide into nihilism, where power alone dictates "truth."

The divine constructivist view is fundamentally incompatible with a functioning pluralistic society. While PO does not challenge belief in a God over reality, it must challenge any theology that invalidates our shared reality as a basis for common reason. If truth is only accessible through one group's exclusive revelation, then there is no common ground between beliefs, only a battle for dominance. This stance undermines procedural symmetry, the equal application of rules to all, by privileging one group's "constructed" truth over observable facts. It is also a performative contradiction, as its proponents must use the tools of our shared reality, language, logic, physical books, to argue that this very reality is not a valid source of truth.

While divine constructivism poses this challenge, the more pervasive modern threat is social constructivism. The appeal of this viewpoint is understandable. It can feel empowering to believe that we create our own reality. It feels sophisticated to see through the supposedly "naive" assumptions of a realist. And for the activist, it offers a powerful tool: if a "truth" like a social hierarchy or a traditional moral code is merely a human construction, then it can be "deconstructed" and replaced with a new, more just construction.

But this line of thinking, while seductive, employs a classic motte-and-bailey fallacy, retreating to defensible ground when challenged while advancing radical claims from it. The motte is the innocuous observation: some social institutions are "constructed" through human agreement. The bailey, however, exploits this to assert that *all* realities, biological, moral, even physical, are mere constructs, open to deconstruction and reconstruction at will. This erodes tiered responsibilities, as family bonds become "oppressive constructs" to dismantle, and generational obligations dissolve if humanity itself must either align with the current good construction or be willed to perish.

Beyond this logical sleight-of-hand lies the undeniable, brute-force feedback of the real world. No matter how passionately a society "constructs" the belief that a certain poison is a health tonic, the people who drink it will still die. No matter how sincerely a culture believes that an unsound engineering principle will hold up a bridge, the bridge will still collapse under the indifferent force of gravity. The airplane that flies, the antibiotic that cures, the crop that grows, these are all testaments to the fact that there is a real, structured world, and that discovering the truths of its operation yields powerful, life-giving results. Constructivism has no coherent answer for this relentless, consequential reality.

A more subtle constructivist might concede the reality of the physical world but argue that all *social* realities, like money, laws, and nations, are fictions. But this mistakes a *consequence* of reality for an arbitrary *construction*. Money is not an arbitrary fiction. It is a tool that naturally emerges to solve the real-world problem of trade among specialized laborers. Nations are not arbitrary fictions. They are the result of the real-world fact that different groups of people have different values and require different systems of law. The PO thinker does not seek to "deconstruct" these institutions as if they were imaginary. Instead, we take *responsibility* for managing these natural consequences of social reality. The goal is not to tear down, but to understand, improve, and build better, aligning with goodness rooted in human life continuing well.

The evil that social constructivism produces is not merely theoretical. A world where truth is simply a function of power is a world where any atrocity can be justified. The great totalitarian movements of the 20th century were exercises in social constructivism on a terrifying scale. They sought to demolish the old reality, the old loyalties, the old moralities, the old definitions of human nature, and to construct a "New Man" in their own ideological image. Anyone who clung to the old reality had to be liquidated as an enemy of the new "truth."

Contemporary examples illustrate this danger clustering in action. In queer theory, a radical offshoot of social constructivism, proponents explicitly aim to "destroy all norms," including those of sex, biology, and age. For instance, claims that "adult is a social construct," alongside "woman and man are social constructs," serve as a wedge to undermine protections like age of consent, portraying children as an "oppressed class" needing "liberation" for sexual relations with adults. This is no exaggeration; academics in this field openly advocate destroying reality's boundaries, with steps like normalizing puberty blockers for minors as precursors to broader norm erosion. Such views cluster with the "Critical Wedge". In education this manifests as a reimagined curriculum model that shifts from teaching objective knowledge to "de-colonising the curriculum," "unlearning things," and "co-creating knowledge" to empower students as "critical consumers and creators", effectively attempting to construct reality through activism rather than discovering reality. Again in education this cluster denies the "banking model" of education (describing reality to students) in favor of imagining a new world, but in practice, it detaches judgment from evidence, misallocates love by prioritizing ideological aspirations over family responsibilities, and identifies enemies not by real threats but by resistance to the new "construction."

Procedural Objectivism refutes this view, first and foremost, by pointing out that it is self-refuting. The person who stands before you and argues that "all truth is a social construct" is presenting that very statement as an objective truth about the nature of the world. They expect you to understand their words, to follow their logic, and to agree with their conclusion based on the evidence they present. They must assume the existence of a shared, knowable reality in order to argue against it. The theory eats its own tail.

This is why constructivism is the polar opposite of the PO virtue of humility. It is an act of profound intellectual arrogance to place the human mind and its stories above reality itself. It is pure reason detached from the world, a sophisticated hallucination. It is the martial artist who believes a fight is merely a "constructed text" about violence, right up until the moment a real fist, governed by the real laws of physics, connects with his jaw. The antidote to constructivism is to return to a humble and respectful engagement with the world as it is, to see ourselves not as the authors of reality, but as its students and mapmakers. We do not claim our maps are perfect, but we insist that a real territory exists, and that our lives depend on making our maps as accurate as possible. In doing so, we safeguard the clusters of PO principles, responsibility, judgment, love, and forgiveness, ensuring human flourishing against the chaos of willed illusions.
