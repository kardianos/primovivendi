# Part VI: Contrasting Procedural Objectivism

## Chapter 13: Contrasting Symmetry

To truly understand a philosophy, one must understand not only what it asserts, but also what it rejects. Over the next chapters, we will place Procedural Objectivism in direct contrast with conflicting philosophies. This process will sharpen the edges of our definitions and make clear the practical, real-world consequences of choosing one philosophical path over another. We begin with the concept of justice, which every society must define. At the heart of any theory of justice lies a chosen form of "symmetry", a principle that determines what a fair and balanced social interaction looks like. The choice of which symmetry to value is one of the most consequential a society can make.

The first major rival is Value Symmetry, a principle of justice based on retribution. Its core belief is that fairness is achieved when a perpetrator receives a punishment of equal value to the harm they inflicted. This is the ancient logic of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." We must first acknowledge its appeal. It speaks to a primal human desire for retribution and the balancing of scales. And historically, it served a crucial purpose: it acted as a *limit*. In a world where the natural human impulse might be to seek vengeance ten times greater than the original offense, "an eye for an eye" puts a cap on the cycle of revenge. It says, "this much, and no more."

In parts of the west, historically Value Symmetry has been called lex talionis and restricted the amount of retribution that could be exacted. In the modern world the only places value symmetry is encoded into law in the notion of Qisas, an aspect of Islamic Sharia Law, in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan. It allows the victim or the victim's family exact equal amount of bodily harm or to be paid some amount of money to compensate for the value of the crime. Procedural Objectivism rejects Value Symmetry as a basis for a modern legal system. It is fundamentally backward-looking, focused on settling a past grievance rather than building a stable future. Its application is often subjective and inflammatory, how does one precisely measure the "value" of a lost reputation or a lifetime of trauma? And it too often leads to escalating cycles of vendetta, destabilizing the very social order it aims to protect. Justice, in PO, should be about restoring order and upholding a fair process, not about the meticulous infliction of equal harm. That being said, Procedural Objectivism does not directly reject corporal punishments, such as the use of Caning in Singapore, so long as it is given as a violation of the law in a prescribed manner, and not as a retribution of value.

The second, more modern rival is Outcome Symmetry, the core principle of egalitarianism. This is the belief that justice is achieved only when all individuals in a society have the same, or roughly the same, outcomes in terms of wealth, status, and well-being. The moral appeal of this vision is powerful; it is born from a sincere and compassionate desire to eliminate poverty and suffering. Who would not want a world where no one is left behind?

The goal of Outcome Symmetry is not equality of opportunity, but **equity** of outcome. Equity, in this context, is the unequal treatment of individuals to correct for unequal group results. It requires constant intervention by a central authority to rebalance outcomes, as free people will never produce identical results.

This worldview is defined by its focus on group identity over individual action. An individual is seen not as a sovereign actor, but primarily as a representative of their identity group (defined by race, class, etc.). The unit of moral analysis shifts from the individual to the group average. Individual merit, choices, and culpability become secondary to the statistical outcomes of the group to which one belongs.

Society is understood as a battlefield of identity groups locked in a zero-sum struggle for power. These groups are arranged into a binary of Oppressors and the Oppressed. This is a direct intellectual inheritance from Karl Marx, who framed all of history as a class struggle between the bourgeoisie (oppressors) and the proletariat (oppressed). Mao Zedong extended this by demonstrating the method of cultural revolution, where existing institutions, norms, and traditions must be actively dismantled to achieve the desired outcome.

This logic follows a clear, four-step process:

1.  **Systemic Oppression as Axiom:** The starting premise is that society's core institutions, its laws, its culture, its economic systems, are inherently biased. They are understood to be "systemically racist," "patriarchal," "ableist," or otherwise rigged to benefit oppressor groups.

2.  **Disparate Impact as Proof:** Any observed disparity in outcomes between identity groups is treated as sufficient evidence of this systemic oppression. A neutral process that produces an unequal result is, by definition, an unjust process. The unequal outcome itself is the only proof required.

3.  **Lived Experience as Truth:** The subjective "lived experience" of individuals from oppressed groups is elevated as a primary form of evidence. This narrative is often held to be more authentic and authoritative than objective data or established principles like the Rule of Law.

4.  **Dismantling Power via The Equity Tool:** The moral imperative becomes the active dismantling of the oppressive systems and the unequal power structures they support. Law and social policy become **The Equity Tool**, an instrument used not for neutral arbitration, but for actively rebalancing power and resources between groups. In a courtroom, this means an individual's sentence is reduced because their identity group is seen as a victim of the system, making the system a co-conspirator in the crime.

The intellectual framework that employs this logic is known as **Critical Theory**, a school of thought that critiques society by applying knowledge from the social sciences and humanities to uncover and challenge power structures.

This single framework has given rise to numerous fields of study and activism. Examples of Critical Theory today includes, but is not limited to:

1.  Critical Race Theory
2.  Critical Legal Studies
3.  Feminist Theory
4.  Queer Theory
5.  Postcolonial Theory
6.  Critical Disability Theory
7.  Fat Studies
8.  Critical Pedagogy
9.  Critical Whiteness Studies
10. Critical Management Studies
11. Critical Animal Studies
12. Critical Geopolitics
13. Critical Media Studies
14. Critical Psychiatry
15. Mad Pride
16. Critical Information Studies
17. Critical Urban Theory
18. Settler Colonial Studies
19. Intersectionality

This utopian dream is based on a fundamental denial of reality. Individuals are not the same. They are born with different talents, they cultivate different work ethics, they have different preferences, and they encounter different circumstances in life. To force equal outcomes from these unequal inputs, a society must, by definition, treat people unequally. It must punish the productive, the innovative, and the diligent by confiscating the fruits of their labor. It must reward idleness or poor choices by subsidizing them with the efforts of others. This is a perversion of fairness.

The core error of this view is its misinterpretation of difference as injustice. Acknowledging that people start from different places, it wrongly concludes that all unequal results are therefore illegitimate. It fails to see that in a non-zero-sum world, it is perfectly just for a diligent person to prosper while another lives a more modest but equally dignified life.

Procedural Symmetry stands in stark contrast to both value symmetry and outcome symmetry. It states that justice is found not in the result, but in the fairness of the game. Everyone, from the richest to the poorest, must play by the same set of rules, be judged by the same impartial laws, and have the same opportunity to strive and succeed. It works *with* human nature by allowing individuals to benefit from their own efforts, thus encouraging the very productivity and innovation that elevates the standard of living for everyone. It is the only form of justice compatible with a free, prosperous, and virtuous society.

The practical implications of this choice are immense. In a courtroom, the Value Symmetry advocate wants to exact equal retribution. The Outcome Symmetry advocate wants to blame the crime on socioeconomic forces. The Procedural Symmetry advocate wants to know one thing: did the accused violate a clear law, as determined by a fair and standard procedure? In a classroom, the Outcome Symmetry advocate may seek to eliminate advanced classes to ensure no student feels "behind" and to force equal outcomes, effectively holding back the brightest. The Procedural Symmetry advocate insists that every student has access to quality instruction and is held to the same high academic standards, allowing each to achieve their own level of excellence. The symmetry a society chooses determines whether it will be a society of vengeance, a society of enforced mediocrity, or a society of opportunity. Procedural Objectivism unequivocally chooses the latter.
