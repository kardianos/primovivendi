# Part VI: The Crossroads - PO in Contrast

## Chapter 13: Symmetry Showdown: Procedural vs. Value and Outcome

To truly understand a philosophy, one must understand not only what it asserts, but also what it rejects. Over the next chapters, we will place Procedural Objectivism in direct contrast with its chief philosophical rivals. This process will sharpen the edges of our definitions and make clear the practical, real-world consequences of choosing one philosophical path over another. We begin with the concept of justice, which every society must define. At the heart of any theory of justice lies a chosen form of "symmetry", a principle that determines what a fair and balanced social interaction looks like. The choice of which symmetry to value is one of the most consequential a society can make.

The first major rival is Value Symmetry, a principle of justice based on retribution. Its core belief is that fairness is achieved when a perpetrator receives a punishment of equal value to the harm they inflicted. This is the ancient logic of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." We must first acknowledge its appeal. It speaks to a primal human desire for retribution and the balancing of scales. And historically, it served a crucial purpose: it acted as a *limit*. In a world where the natural human impulse might be to seek vengeance ten times greater than the original offense, "an eye for an eye" puts a cap on the cycle of revenge. It says, "this much, and no more."

Despite this, Procedural Objectivism rejects Value Symmetry as a basis for a modern legal system. It is fundamentally backward-looking, focused on settling a past grievance rather than building a stable future. Its application is often subjective and inflammatory, how does one precisely measure the "value" of a lost reputation or a lifetime of trauma? And it too often leads to escalating cycles of vendetta, destabilizing the very social order it aims to protect. Justice, in PO, should be about restoring order and upholding a fair process, not about the meticulous infliction of equal harm.

The second, more modern rival is Outcome Symmetry, the core principle of egalitarianism. This is the belief that justice is achieved only when all individuals in a society have the same, or roughly the same, outcomes in terms of wealth, status, and well-being. The moral appeal of this vision is powerful; it is born from a sincere and compassionate desire to eliminate poverty and suffering. Who would not want a world where no one is left behind?

Yet, this utopian dream is based on a fundamental denial of reality. Individuals are not the same. They are born with different talents, they cultivate different work ethics, they have different preferences, and they encounter different circumstances in life. To force equal outcomes from these unequal inputs, a society must, by definition, treat people unequally. It must punish the productive, the innovative, and the diligent by confiscating the fruits of their labor. It must reward idleness or poor choices by subsidizing them with the efforts of others. This is a perversion of fairness.

To return to our sports analogy, forcing Outcome Symmetry is like demanding that every game end in a tie. To achieve this, a referee would have to constantly penalize the stronger team and actively help the weaker one. While we acknowledge that teams start with different strengths, and individuals in life face different circumstances, the goal is not a bland and artificial equality of result. Unlike many sports, most of life is not a zero-sum game where one person's gain is another's loss. It is perfectly just for one person to become wealthy through excellent work and prudent risk-taking, while another lives a more modest but equally dignified life. Outcome Symmetry wrongly frames this natural and healthy diversity of results as an injustice that must be "corrected."

To enforce this correction, a society dedicated to Outcome Symmetry requires a massively powerful and intrusive state. Since free people will naturally produce unequal outcomes, the only way to maintain equality is through constant, coercive intervention, confiscating wealth, controlling prices, and dictating individual choices. This system also destroys the very incentives that create prosperity. If extra effort is not rewarded, and lack of effort is not penalized, the rational choice for everyone is to do less. The result is not universal wealth, but universal poverty. Furthermore, mercy cannot exist in such a system. Any deviation from perfect equality is seen as an ongoing injustice that must be rectified, leaving no room for grace or discretionary compassion.

Procedural Symmetry stands in stark contrast to both of these rivals. It states that justice is found not in the result, but in the fairness of the game. Everyone, from the richest to the poorest, must play by the same set of rules, be judged by the same impartial laws, and have the same opportunity to strive and succeed. It works *with* human nature by allowing individuals to benefit from their own efforts, thus encouraging the very productivity and innovation that elevates the standard of living for everyone. It is the only form of justice compatible with a free, prosperous, and virtuous society.

The practical implications of this choice are immense. In a courtroom, the Value Symmetry advocate wants to make the criminal suffer. The Outcome Symmetry advocate wants to blame the crime on socioeconomic forces. The Procedural Symmetry advocate wants to know one thing: did the accused violate a clear law, as determined by a fair and standard procedure? In a classroom, the Outcome Symmetry advocate may seek to eliminate advanced classes to ensure no student feels "behind," effectively holding back the brightest. The Procedural Symmetry advocate insists that every student has access to quality instruction and is held to the same high academic standards, allowing each to achieve their own level of excellence. The symmetry a society chooses determines whether it will be a society of vengeance, a society of enforced mediocrity, or a society of liberty and opportunity. Procedural Objectivism unequivocally chooses the latter.
