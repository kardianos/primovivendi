## Chapter 6: The Necessity of Judgment

In our modern culture, the word “judgmental” is often used as a sharp insult. We are taught that to judge is to be unkind, intolerant, and arrogant. The highest virtue, we are often told, is to be “non-judgmental,” to accept everyone and everything without critique. While this sentiment may be well-intentioned, born from a desire for a more compassionate world, it is a dangerously misguided and self-defeating idea. Procedural Objectivism asserts the opposite: Judgment is not a vice to be avoided, but a necessary and positive good. It is the essential tool we must use to build a worthy life and a decent society.

We must begin by defining our terms with precision. In the context of this philosophy, judgment is not an emotional outburst of condemnation. Judgment is the act of discernment. It is the intellectual process of separating what is good from what is not good. It is the application of a standard to a fact. When you choose to eat a healthy meal instead of junk food, you are making a judgment about what is good for your body. When you choose an honest friend over a deceptive one, you are making a judgment about character. When you choose to step out of the path of an oncoming car, you are making a judgment about what is conducive to survival. To live is to judge, constantly and unavoidably. To refuse to judge is to refuse to think.

The necessity of judgment flows directly from our axiom of goodness. If our moral purpose is to ensure that “human life should continue and continue well,” then we are morally obligated to constantly assess whether our actions, and the actions of others, are moving us toward or away from that goal. We must separate the helpful from the harmful, the productive from the destructive, the true from the false. Without this constant act of separation, we are flying blind. We have a destination, but we have thrown our compass overboard.

Think of judgment as the immune system of a society, or of an individual’s life. An immune system’s entire function is to discern and separate “self” from “non-self,” to identify and neutralize pathogens that threaten the health of the organism. A body that loses this ability, that becomes “non-judgmental” about the cells within it, will quickly be overrun by infection or cancer and will die. So too with a society. A society that refuses to judge and separate harmful behaviors from beneficial ones is a society that has lost its will to live. It will be consumed by the social pathogens of crime, corruption, and decay. Goodness cannot possibly thrive if it is not protected from that which seeks to undermine it.

This act of separation is vital. Goodness needs a protected space to flourish, just as a garden needs a fence and a diligent gardener. The gardener must constantly judge which plants are flowers and which are weeds. He must discern which insects are pollinators and which are pests. He then acts on these judgments, separating the weeds from the soil and the pests from the leaves. This “judgmental” action is precisely what allows the garden to become beautiful and productive. A “non-judgmental” gardener, one who saw no difference between a rose and a thistle, would not preside over a garden; he would preside over a tangled, chaotic wilderness.

The laws and social norms that make civilization possible are nothing more than formalized, collective judgments. Our laws against assault, theft, and fraud are the public declaration by our society that these behaviors have been judged as “not good.” Our informal social norms against lying, cheating, and rudeness are the private, distributed enforcement of the same principle. They are the lines we have drawn, through generations of trial and error, to separate the actions that build social trust from those that destroy it. The alternative to this system of judgment is not a kinder world; it is chaos. It is a world where standards inevitably decline to the lowest common denominator, because there is no mechanism to uphold them.

It is human nature to resist negative judgment. No one enjoys being told they are wrong, and it is often painful to learn our actions have been hurtful. Our pride recoils from criticism, and a lack of humility can make any critique feel like a personal attack. Yet our culture has taken this natural aversion and amplified it into a sweeping philosophical error, arguing that because judgment feels bad, the act of judgment is bad. This mistake is deepened by confusing true judgment with its corrupted forms: hypocrisy and self-righteousness.

Good judgment, in the PO framework, is the consistent application of a righteous standard. Hypocrisy is the inconsistent application, judging others for faults you excuse in yourself. The solution to hypocrisy is not to stop judging, but to judge fairly, to apply the principle of procedural symmetry and hold ourselves to the same standard first. Likewise, we must distinguish the act of judgment from the emotion of condemnation. Judgment is a cool, rational assessment of an action against a standard. Condemnation is often a hot, emotional declaration about the permanent and irredeemable state of another person's soul. Procedural Objectivism is concerned with judging actions and their consequences in the current real world, not with damning souls for eternity.

Of course, it is painful to be on the receiving end of a negative judgment. No one enjoys being told that their work is shoddy or that their behavior is unacceptable. But this pain, like the pain of touching a hot stove, can be a productive and life-saving signal. It is feedback from reality, delivered through our community, telling us that our actions are not aligned with the good. It is a vital opportunity to correct our course. A society that tries to protect everyone from the pain of negative judgment is a society that is robbing its members of the essential feedback they need to learn and grow.

To live well, we must not only accept judgment, but we must practice it according to clear principles. The first principle is that good judgment must always be anchored in reality. We must judge what a person actually did or said, based on facts and evidence, not on rumor, gossip, or our own emotional projections. The second principle is the application of the standard: we must judge the action against the axiom of goodness. Does it contribute to or detract from life and flourishing? The third, and most important, principle is procedural symmetry. The standard must be applied to all people in the same way. The rules for our enemies must be the same as the rules for our friends. This is our powerful safeguard against biased, self-serving, and hypocritical judgment. The fourth principle is humility. Good judgment requires us to recognize that our knowledge is incomplete and our perspective is limited. This means we should be cautious, especially when judging the motives of others. We can judge the act and its clear consequences with confidence, but we should be far more circumspect about claiming to know what is in another's heart.

The fifth principle governs our reaction. The judgment itself is a clear, often binary, separation: this action was aligned with "living well" (good), or it was not. The *response* to that judgment, however, must be proportional to the act. We do not respond to a child’s white lie with the same severity as we respond to a violent crime. Wisdom lies not in the simple act of judgment, but in the difficult art of calibrating the consequences, be they praise or penalty, to the magnitude of the action being judged. The separation is absolute; the response is scaled.

Consider a manager who must deal with a poorly performing employee. A good judgment proceeds thus: He first gathers the objective facts about the employee’s performance (anchoring in reality). He assesses that this performance is damaging the team’s ability to function and thrive (the standard of goodness). He ensures that the performance standard he is applying is the same one used for every other employee (procedural symmetry). He acknowledges that there may be factors in the employee’s life he doesn't know about, so he focuses on the performance itself, not the employee's character (humility). The judgment is made: the performance is "not good." His *response* is then proportional: a formal warning and a clear plan for improvement, not an immediate and angry dismissal. The judgment is sharp and clear; the response is measured and fair.

This brings us to the relationship between judgment and mercy. True mercy can only exist *after* a negative judgment has been made. To be merciful is to choose not to apply the full, just consequences that an action deserves. If you never judge an act as wrong in the first place, you cannot be merciful; you are merely being permissive. Permissiveness is weakness; mercy is a form of strength, a conscious choice made by one who has the power and the right to impose a harsher penalty.

In a culture that fears clarity, the simple act of making a clear-eyed moral judgment can be an act of courage. It may mean standing against the crowd or challenging a comfortable consensus. But it is an obligation we must accept. To see something that is harmful to life and flourishing and to say nothing, to do nothing, to make no judgment, is to be complicit in the harm. It is to be the gardener who watches, hands in pockets, as the weeds choke the life out of his flowers. Judgment is not the enemy of goodness. Judgment is the necessary, disciplined, and courageous guardian of everything we hold dear.
