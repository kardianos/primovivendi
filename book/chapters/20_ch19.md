## Chapter 19: The Nation and the World

The principles of Procedural Objectivism scale from the individual and community to the broader tiers of the nation and the world. A PO citizen’s relationship with their country is one of principled patriotism, not blind nationalism. A patriot in this view does not believe their country is always right. Rather, their loyalty is to the *system* of procedural symmetry and the Rule of Law that their nation ideally represents. It is a loyalty to the framework of liberty that allows their family and community to live and live well.

This patriotism is expressed through the responsible actions of citizenship: obeying just laws, paying taxes, staying informed, and participating in the civic process. When faced with a contentious national election, the PO citizen does not view it as a team sport where the only goal is the victory of their chosen party. They judge candidates and policies against the objective standards of the philosophy. Does this candidate show respect for constitutional checks and balances? Will this policy, based on the evidence from reality, likely lead to long-term prosperity and stability, or will it create harmful unintended consequences? They engage in political discussion by asking principled questions, not by trading emotional insults.

A PO citizen judges their nation’s history with the same realism. They acknowledge and take responsibility for the times the nation has violated its own stated principles of liberty and justice. This is the virtue of humility applied at a national scale. But they also value and seek to preserve the inherited structures, the Constitution, the Rule of Law, the cultural traditions of responsibility, that have produced immense good. This is the virtue of generational obligation. The goal is not to tear down a flawed history, but to learn from it in order to bring the nation into closer alignment with its own best principles.

When looking beyond the nation’s borders, the PO citizen adopts a sober and realistic view. The world is a collection of states, each with its own values and interests. The fantasy of a harmonious world government is a dangerous one, as it ignores the reality that different civilizations have fundamentally incompatible axioms of goodness. A nation’s government must, therefore, practice tiered responsibility. Its primary and non-negotiable duty is the safety, freedom, and prosperity of its own citizens.

A prudent foreign policy categorizes other nations realistically. Allies are those who share a commitment to similar core principles, like liberty and the Rule of Law. Rivals are those with different systems, but with whom peaceful competition and trade are possible. Enemies are those regimes whose stated ideology and demonstrable actions mark them as an existential threat.

The default stance of a PO foreign policy is non-intervention. This is born of humility, the recognition that we cannot possibly understand the deep complexities of other cultures well enough to “fix” them. Military intervention is the most serious action a nation can take and is justified only in clear, direct self-defense against a recognized enemy. It cannot be justified for idealistic crusades like “nation-building,” which are utopian projects that inevitably fail at an immense cost in blood and treasure.

A responsible nation maintains control over its own borders, with a clear, fair, and symmetrical procedure for legal immigration. The primary question guiding this policy should be: will the proposed immigrants likely contribute to the nation “living well,” by embracing its core principles of liberty and responsibility and contributing to its economic life?

The PO citizen understands that the world is not a global community to be managed with empathy. It is an arena of different, often competing, civilizations. To survive and flourish, a nation must be prudent, clear-eyed, and guided by a principled self-interest, which is ultimately the long-term well-being of its own people. This realistic and responsible patriotism is the final piece of the blueprint for a society where life can continue, and continue well.
