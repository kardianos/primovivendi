# Part III: Bridging From What Is to What Should Be

## Chapter 4: The Axiom of Goodness: To Live and Live Well

We have now established the twin foundations of our philosophy: a real and knowable world, and a realistic assessment of the humans who live in it. These foundations, by themselves, are not enough. They tell us what *is*, but they cannot, on their own, tell us what we *should* do. Reason grounded in reality is a powerful tool for navigating a path to a destination, but it cannot choose the destination for you.

To have any moral system at all, any concept of "good" or "bad," we must have a standard. We need an ultimate, foundational value that we choose to pursue for its own sake. This is the moral North Star by which all other actions and values will be judged. Without such an anchor, morality may dissolve into mere personal preference. No common ground for ethical discussion can be found.

Procedural Objectivism is transparent about this necessary step. It acknowledges that a choice must be made. This choice is not arbitrary, like choosing a favorite color. A good moral axiom must be universal enough to apply to all people, fundamental enough to serve as the prerequisite for other values, and grounded enough to be compatible with the world we have established.

Life is chosen as this value because it is the non-negotiable prerequisite for all other values. You cannot pursue justice, create beauty, seek knowledge, or experience love if you are not alive. Survival is the ticket that grants you admission to the entire arena of human experience. Every other philosophical debate is a luxury afforded to those who have already succeeded at the most basic task of all: continuing to exist. This choice is also grounded in the revealed preference of all of human history. Every single person alive today is the endpoint of a vast, unbroken chain of ancestors stretching back into the mists of time. Every one of those ancestors, faced with countless trials, ultimately made the choice, consciously or instinctually, to survive and reproduce. To affirm life is to affirm the legacy that has brought us here.

The choice, therefore, is not arbitrary, but grounded. This leads us to the foundational axiom of goodness for Procedural Objectivism: **The foundation of goodness is that human life should continue and continue well, both generationally and individually.**

The first part of the axiom is that life should "continue." This speaks to both individual survival and, crucially, to generational survival. It asserts that a core component of goodness is the act of having and raising the next generation, of passing the gift of life forward. This immediately imbues Procedural Objectivism with a forward-looking, long-term perspective. A good life is not lived only for the moment; it contributes to the great, ongoing chain of humanity.

The second part, "and continue well," is what elevates this philosophy beyond mere animal survival. It is not enough just to exist; the goal is to flourish. "Living well" is the pursuit of quality, health, prosperity, and purpose. This second clause prevents the axiom from justifying a grim "survival at any cost" mentality. It affirms that the *quality* of our lives is a profound moral concern.

"Living well," however, is not a destination. It is not a utopia. There is no point at which one can say, "I have now arrived at the state of 'living well.'" Rather, living well is a *vector*, a direction, not a location. It is measured by the positive slope between two points in time.

Think of a simple, concrete example: keeping your floor clean. At Time A, the floor is dirty. It gets your feet dirty, which in turn gets your bedsheets dirty. This is a small friction, a minor impediment to living well. You then take responsibility and sweep the floor. At Time B, the floor is clean, your feet are clean, and your sheets stay clean. The slope between Time A and Time B is positive. This small act of imposing order on chaos *is* the process of living well in microcosm.

This concept is universally applicable, regardless of one's wealth or position in life. A prisoner in a cell can seek to live well within his constraints by keeping his small space clean, exercising his body, and reading to improve his mind. A billionaire can seek to live well by managing resources responsibly and creating value for others. The specific actions differ, but the underlying principle is the same: to take ownership of one's circumstances and act in a way that makes them better. Living well is the constant, active process of moving from a state of lesser order, health, and purpose to a state of greater order, health, and purpose.

Procedural Objectivism is explicit about this standard. Other compatible frameworks arrive at the same conclusion by different means. Some posit the axiom as a divine command; others see it as an entity's intrinsic purpose, its *telos*. Provided this command or telos affirms that human life should continue and flourish, it is functionally aligned with the moral foundation of Procedural Objectivism.

With this axiom in place, we now have a clear, non-arbitrary standard for judgment. To evaluate any action, any system, or any idea, we can ask a single, powerful question: On balance, and over the long term, does this contribute to or detract from humans living and continuing well?

Consider the act of theft. For the victim, theft is clearly "not good," as it diminishes their resources and their ability to live well. A thief may see a short-term gain, but they endorse a principle that, if universalized, would make their own life insecure. It erodes the social trust and stability necessary for *any* member of society to flourish. We can judge theft to be objectively bad according to our standard.

Procedural Objectivism also holds that this form of goodness is not just in the eye of the beholder, but can be reasonably understood and known. Because reality is consequential, and because we have chosen a fixed criterion for judgment, we can make objective statements about what is good. The statement, "All other things being equal, it is better to rest one's hand on a soft pillow than on a hot flame," is not a matter of subjective opinion. It is an objectively true statement about what contributes to a human being's physical well-being. Goodness, in this view, is not a mysterious metaphysical property; it is a measure of an action's alignment with the flourishing of life.

Because we are limited beings, our understanding of what will *ultimately* produce goodness is always imperfect. We can be wrong. The world is complex, and the long-term consequences of our actions are not always clear. The pursuit of the good must always be undertaken with humility, with a constant willingness to check our ideas against real-world outcomes and adjust our course when the evidence demands it.

By explicitly choosing the continuation and flourishing of human life as our foundational value, we have established a moral purpose. This choice is not arbitrary because it affirms the prerequisite for all other possible values. It gives us a stable, reality-based standard by which we can navigate the endless choices of life. Now that we have a moral destination, the next question is: how do we organize a society of limited, selfish individuals to move in that direction? This leads us to the unifying principles of a society: Procedural Symmetry.
