# Outline

* Introduction
  - "society needs common ground", "minimal overlapping consensus" for people of radically different metaphysics (Christians, atheists, agnostics, etc.), while deliberately excluding those who reject reality/truth (post-modernists, critical constructivists).
  - Precepts seek to describe what is good, not why. Many people have different reasons for believing why something is good. -- not a total worldview replacement.
* Part 1: Foundation
  - Reality is Real, knowable, and consequential. Truth is what corresponds to reality.
  - Humans are limited, selfish, and not naturally good. -- "Life has limits to what can be done... Life can be good despite the restrictions of reality."
  - Tiered Self-Anchored Responsibility.
    - "At the core of societal principles is the will to live. I desire to live and live well... I divide my will between myself and my children... extended family... community... nation..."
    - "You must first care for yourself by putting on the oxygen mask in a troubled airplane, before you show care to your family..."
  - What must be good.
  - Procedural Symmetry
* Part 2: Individual
  - Align with Truth
  - Seek Excellence
  - Admire and Create Beauty
    - In practice: tidy home, good posture, clear speech, art, nature.
  - Take Responsibility
    - Responsibility as Ownership
    - Ownership as creating and maintaining
    - Society Specializes
    - Sacrifice
    - Make judgments.
    - As a platform for Joy. "When it is normal for you to keep the house clean, you can enjoy doing more things in the house; the clean house creates a platform for dancing or playing a game, or having friends over."
  - Love & Forgive
    - Dispositional Love
    - Action-based Love
    - Personal Forgiveness
    - Social Reconciliation
    - Love is holding on.
    - Forgiveness is letting go.
  - Have Children
     - Will to live
     - Surviving, symmetry
     - Joy, Love, Meaning.
* Part 3: State
  - Align With Truth -> Freedom of speech, required to seek alignment with truth
  - Procedural Symmetry -> Rule of Law (impartial process, no rule by man, no selective prosecution).
    - Against Shoplifting, pollution (if everyone did it symmetry).
    - Behavioral Limit.
  - Responsibility and Ownership Extended, -> Economic Freedom and Specialization (property, markets, sound money as extensions of individual responsibility), power to defend yourself
  - Tiered Responsibility in the Polity -> Defense, Borders, and Prioritizing Citizens (immigration, military, citizen-only benefits/obligations). 
  - The State’s Role in Human Goodness -> Enabling Families (zoning for housing, safety, minimal pro-natal policies, education that reinforces responsibility)
* Part 4: Deeper Grounding
  - Reason in Service to Reality
  - Survival and Flourishing as the Root Axiom
  - Compatibility with Historic Wisdom Traditions (short sections on Judaism, Christianity; brief honest note on Islam)
  - Discovered vs. Constructed
* Part 5: Distinctions
  - Strength, Not Weakness
  - Responsibility, Not Mere Sacrifice
    - "Any person who believes in unbounded love is not humble... does not recognize their own limitations."
    - Call out child activists as exploitative and narcissistic. Children must not take on this responsibility.
  - Procedural Fairness, Not Equal Outcomes
  - No Fusion of Religious and Political Authority
  - Life, Not Nihilism -> Positive Capstone
